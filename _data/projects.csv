Predicting coastal ecological futures in an era of unprecedented change,current,https://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2021/08/12/future-fellowship.html,A/Prof Chris Brown,"Chris is currently funded by the Australian Research Council
  (2021-2025) Future Fellowship. His project aims to study how we can predict
  unprecedented ecological futures",
Global Prioritization of Mangrove Conservation and Restoration incorporating future Climate Change Impacts,current,https://globalwetlandsproject.org/mangrove/,"A/Prof Chris Brown, Prof Rod Connolly, Dr Fernanda Adame, Dr Christina Buelow","The Global Wetlands Projet team is working with the World Wildlife Fund to

Global wetlands project,past,https://globalwetlandsproject.org/,"A/Prof Chris Brown, Prof Rod Connolly and many others","The Global Wetlands Project is
 a global research program looking at mapping the health of seagrass, mangroves
  and saltmarsh to inform on conservation actions.",/images/GLOW-logo-wide-01.png
Predicting interactive effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems,past,http://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2021/08/01/multiple-stressors-ecosystems.html,"Dr Chris Brown (lead), Professor Rod Connolly (Simon Fraser University),
  Professor Isabelle Cote","We were funded by the Australian Research Council
  (2018-2021) on a project  Predicting interactive effects of multiple
  stressors on marine ecosystems.
    We developed new models that can make predictions reliable
     enough to inform management of ecosystems,
    and that are effective when data are limited. ",/images/dp18-image.JPG
Risks & Opportunities for the Blue Economy,past,https://blueeconomycrc.com.au/projects/risks-opportunities-for-the-blue-economy/,"Dr Mischa Turschwell, Dr Chris Brown, Dr Beth Fulton (CSIRO),
    Dr Myriam Lacharite (UTas), and many others","This project will deliver an integrative characterisation of risk across engineering and technology,
   production, energy, sustainability and policy. The resulting integrated registry will identify the
  multidimensional envelopes of risk relevant to the Blue Economy activities.",
Improved monitoring and management of Pacific tuna fisheries,past,/research/2021/10/15/Tuna-EM.html,Dr Chris Brown and The Nature Conservancy,"We worked with The Nature Conservancy to improve management of Pacific tuna fisheries, through
  the use of electronic monitoring systems. Our team analyzed trial monitoring data
  and demonstrating how it can be used to inform tuna management and mitigate bycatch",images/bigeye-tuna.jpg
Economic environmental accounting,past,https://www.nespnorthern.edu.au/projects/nesp/environmental-economic-accounting/,"Dr Jim Smart (economics), Professor Sue Jackson (social science),
    Dr Chris Brown and Ms Chantal Saint Ange","We worked with the National Environmental Science Program Northern Hub
  to develop Economic-Environmental accounts for Northern Australia and Coastal ecosystems",
Tools to assess cross-sector interactions in the Blue Economy,past,https://blueeconomycrc.com.au/projects/tools-to-assess-cross-sector-interactions/,"Dr Mischa Turschwell (lead), Dr Chris Brown, Dr Beth Fulton (CSIRO)
    and many others","We worked with the Blue Economy CRC
  to identify tools that can assess opportunities and risks for cross sector
  interactions in the blue economy. These include biodiversity, fisheries,
  aquaculture and offshore renewable energy.",
Predicting fisheries change from cumulative impacts to aquatic habitats.,past,https://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2021/04/05/coral-reef-fisheries.html,Dr Chris Brown,"2016-2019 Dr Chris Brown's Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career

Fishscape: a global database of fish habitat associations,past,http://www.seascapemodels.org/fishscape/,Dr Chris Brown,As part of Dr Chris Brown's Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Award fellowship we created a global database of fish-habitat associations,
Ridge to reef fisheries management,past,https://snappartnership.net/teams/ridges-to-reefs-fisheries/,"Dr Chris Brown, Dr Carissa Klein, Prof Hugh Possingham and many others","2014-2016 The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
  funded us to work on
    ridge to reef fisheries management.
  We helped inform management of catchments on Pacific Islands
to improve coastal water quality, marine habitats and fisheries. 
 We were able to link deforestation to pollution and its
  impacts on coastal ecosystems. Using modelling tools, we could
  then conduct assessments of how land-use change and forest protection
  could benefit coastal fish stocks",
Predicting trade-offs between marine conservation and fisheries,past,,Dr Chris Brown,"2012-2014 Dr Chris Brown's University of Queensland post-doctoral research fellowship. We showed how
marine reserves and fisheries management can be optimized to balance trade-offs between
biodiversity and fisheries objectives. ",
