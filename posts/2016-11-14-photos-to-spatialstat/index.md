## From geotagged photos to species distribution models

My camera comes with an inbuilt GPS allowing you to geotag photos. I was on a family holiday on the beautiful Hornby Island (near Vancouver) and started wondering why the oysters growing on the rocks were so patchy in their distribution. This observation motivated me to get out and count oysters. The camera let me geotag photos of the quadrats I used to standardise my counts.

The oyster data-set has inspired a series of blog posts taking you from geotagged photos, making an interactive web map and finally, using the data in a spatial model.  Here is the contents:

### Part 1: [Extracting exif data from photos](/rstats/2016/11/14/extract-exif.html).

### Part 2: [Create an interactive web map with geotagged photos](/rstats/2016/11/23/mapping-abundance-photos.html).

### Part 3: [Spatial analysis of geotagged data](/rstats/2017/02/22/spatial-statistics-photos.html).

I hope these posts using his simple example inspire some bigger ideas for your own spatial analysis.
