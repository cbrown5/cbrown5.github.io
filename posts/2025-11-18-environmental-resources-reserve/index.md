We need this for resilience to shocks. 
Climate events threaten our resource security, including food wood and other basic supplies. 
War could cut us off from supplies.
THere is a tangible risk of global nuclear war, a nuclear winter would have a massive impact on food production. 

We need to keep more environmental resources in the bank. This applies to water, soil, fisheries, forestry and more. 

This would also be great for our biodiversity problems. 

I'll give examples from two areas I know: fisheries and aquaculture.

Fishesries fished down to 20%, which we are calling sustainable. 
But that's not much in the bank
Need to get it higher, particularly coastal fisheries that are easily accessible
Would be great for production now, as well as biodiversity benefits, e.g. lobster.

Ground water is also being drawn down continuously. We need to recharge that stuff. .

relate to NDIS, national critical minerals reserve

Environmental accounts, system already available to do this.
