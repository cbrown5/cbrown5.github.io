### PhD positions

Sustaining fisheries is important for economies, livelihoods and human health, but globally numerous fisheries are threatened by rapid loss of aquatic habitat. The role of habitat in fishery declines is poorly quantified, and we need new models that integrate existing datasets to attribute change in a fishery to change in its habitats.

I am seeking motivated candidates to work with me on one of a range of projects relating to marine ecology and fisheries.

The PhD projects are flexible but may include analysis of coral reef datasets to understand how fishery species relate to their habitats and/or field work to quantify fishery-habitat relationships.  

I am looking for someone who is motivated by conservation issues and is keen on ecological science, improving resource management and marine conservation.
