## Home isolation work success plan

So Australia is entering into a COVID lockdown and I have my two young kids home with me full time. That means every weekday I have roles as a Dad, a husband, a primary school teacher, a carer, a lecturer, a researcher, a cleaner, a cook and a grad student supervisor. I get asked to be a dinosaur most days too.

So I think I need a plan to be successful. I thought I'd write down my plan for being successful at work now, so I can read it in a few months time and laugh at myself.

This is will start of mild and get more and more extreme, so be warned.

### Keep up the meetings, online

Everyone is doing this. It seems self evident. We have coffee with my research team every morning on Microsoft Teams, I attend when I'm not being the Dad/primary school teacher, and sometimes when I am.

Conversations still aren't as great as they are face-to-face. One thing I've noticed is that listening, I mean really listening, is harder. And I think listening, particularly to my grad students and their concerns, is more important than ever. So something I need to figure out.

### Being proactive about online engagement

I hope to get more proactive with the online stuff soon. Conferences, workshops have been cancelled. I'm hoping aspects of them can still go ahead online. In a few months I want to reschedule my R workshops that were canned, and do them interactively online. Some goes for research workshops

### Work life balance

Not really sure how this will happen. My wife works too, so my work schedule is currently mornings or afternoons (whatever she isn't working) + evenings.

Working and being a school teacher is mentally exhausting!

Finding it hard to find time for exercise, so this will have to be integrated into play with the kids.

### Work balance

This is more achievable. By work balance I mean doing less of the admin I dislike and more of the research/teaching I do like, like workshops with undergrads, R coding and writing.

What's been great about the shift online so far is that meetings are being replaced with 'doing research'. Now I have less meetings with students, but more email requests to look R code (which we share on a server). So I get to dip into their R projects, do a bit of coding, leave some comments and then follow up with a call later.

Hopefully it helps them learn too. I'll keep my eye on that.

### Polyphasic sleep

This is the extreme bit. I'm trying a 2 nap + core sleep schedule, so I can work into the evenings.
