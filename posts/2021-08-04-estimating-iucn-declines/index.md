[In a new study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15571) we predict global carbon emissions from different drives of mangrove deforestation. Our predictions can help nations value mangrove conservation, identify what actions are needed to reduce carbon emissions and set targets for reducing carbon emissions.

**Predicted emissions to 2090 and primary drivers of emissions**

Announcing here that the R code for the study is [now available on github](https://github.com/cbrown5/mangrove-drivers-carbon-emissions/tree/main).

We went an extra step with this model to also produce an interactive web app. So if you want to explore this model, without having to use R, then check out [our interactive web app](https://mangrove-carbon.wetlands.app/).

You can learn more about the study, and watch a tutorial on the web app in [this online seminar](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/carbonapp/).
