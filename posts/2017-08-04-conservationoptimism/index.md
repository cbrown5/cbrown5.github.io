## Impact of the conservation optimism hashtag

The hashtag [\#conservationoptimism](https://twitter.com/hashtag/conservationoptimism?src=hash) became popular during the recent [International Congress for Conservation Biology](http://conbio.org/mini-sites/iccb-2017) symposium.  [Michael Burgass](https://twitter.com/MJBurgass) asked me what its twitter impact was, so here is a quick analysis.


Note that I edited this post (24/08/2017) after Michael Burgass asked me why so few tweets. It turns out (and I hadn't realised) that the twitter API (Application programming interface) will [only return tweets up to 2 weeks old](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24214189/how-can-i-get-tweets-older-than-a-week-using-tweepy-or-other-python-libraries). You have to pay to get older ones. So the data in this post is only relevant to the period over the ICCB conference.

Michael also asked about \#iamaconservationist, but that has too few tweets so far to make for a meaningful analysis (about 100).

There were not a huge amount of of tweets over ICCB conference, so it is hard to say too much from a broad brush quantitative analysis like this, but here are a few stats.

The first tweet I got was only on 2017-07-26 and until now there have been 813 tweets from 390 users of which 133 are original tweets and the rest RTs.

I think that spike on Wednesday corresponds to EJ Milner-Gulland's plenary at ICCB.

The distribution of tweets per user is not quite as skewed as other hashtags I have analysed. I guess becaues there are fewer users and it is the sort of hashtag that people only post once to (thought they may RT multiple others).

That's all. It would be good to do a full historical analysis, but as I note above you probably have to pay for that.
