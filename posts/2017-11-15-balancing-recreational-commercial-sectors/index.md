The Queensland State Election is on 25th November. Past elections have seen promises on new fisheries policy. In a recent article for the [Machinery of Government blog](https://medium.com/the-machinery-of-government/aiming-for-balance-f0f27b5a9503) I discuss opportunities for the new government to create policy that will help achieve a sustainable balance between recreational and commercial sectors in Queensland.

I won't say any more here, [but see the full blog](https://medium.com/the-machinery-of-government/aiming-for-balance-f0f27b5a9503) if you are interested.
