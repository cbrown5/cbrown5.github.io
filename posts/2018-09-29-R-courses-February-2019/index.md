This is an announcement of our next set of R courses. There are 4 separate courses taught over 5th-8th February 2019.  

You can [register with the Centre for Applications in Resource Management site at the University of Queensland](https://smp.uq.edu.au/event/session/5650).  

These R workshops are especially tailored for biology/ecology, but will be useful for anyone working in sciences. We often have people from other sciences, like medicine attend.

Location is at the Centre for Applications in Natural Resource Management, The University of Queensland in Brisbane Australia.
Student discounts on course fees are available.

Presenters:  Prof Anthony Richardson (UQ Centre for Applications in Natural Resource Mathematics), Associate Prof David Schoeman (University of the Sunshine Coast), Dr Chris Brown (Griffith University).  

The Advanced R course is taught by Dr Bill Venables (CSIRO) and long-time R developer.

We provide comprehensive workshop notes, including basic theory, applied worked examples in biology/ecology, and solution code.
Here is the course schedule for 2019.

## Testimonials  

June 2017: “I truly enjoyed the whole workshop. Great teachers, really nice real data examples and good notes and background. Everything was very well thought out and explained.”  

June 2017: “I was really impressed with everything covered and how it was presented. I am feeling a lot better about using stats now than I was previously. I think it should be a compulsory course for all PhDs.”
