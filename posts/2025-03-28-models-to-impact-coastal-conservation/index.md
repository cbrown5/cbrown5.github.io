## Understanding the Impact of Quantitative Ecology

A fundamental question all conservation scientists should ask themselves is: Is our science making a positive difference to the environment? While quantitative ecology has the potential to influence policy and conservation efforts, it can also be misused or misinterpreted. For instance, the value of coastal wetlands for carbon storage has been so well-promoted that it has led to the proliferation of questionable carbon offset projects.

## The Theory of Change

Its important that we understand the theory of change behind our scientific work. Scientists should think critically about how their research can lead to tangible environmental benefits. Below I'll share some examples from the [Global Wetlands Project (GLOW)](globalmangrovewatch.org), which has been running for over seven years, to illustrate different theories of change in action.

## Three Models to Make Science More Relevant to Conservation

I proposed three models to enhance the relevance of scientific research to conservation efforts:

1. **Communication and Advocacy**: Effective communication of research findings is crucial. For example, studies on animal responses to coastal wetland restoration have shown significant increases in abundance and diversity compared to degraded sites. By publishing these findings and engaging with media and apps, scientists can motivate restoration efforts.

2. **Open Data**: Making data freely available allows for its reuse in various contexts. For instance, biodiversity credit markets can use open data to finance conservation projects. This approach aligns with global goals to halt biodiversity loss, double protection efforts, and restore ecosystems.

3. **Codevelop Science with Policy Makers**: Collaborating with policy makers and NGOs ensures that scientific research informs and supports policy decisions. The Global Wetlands Project work has been used by organizations like WWF to develop strategies for mangrove conservation and community engagement.

**Engaging with NGOs and Policy Makers**

Its important to engage with NGOs and policy makers to ensure that scientific research translates into actionable policies. By providing data and tools, such as the Blue Forests Data Explorer, scientists can help NGOs like WWF make informed decisions about conservation strategies.

**Advice for Students and Professors**

For students, I recommend planning a theory of change for your projects, seeking internships, and valuing applied science. For professors, I advise becoming advisors, looking for policy relevance in their research, and actively engaging with policy makers and the community.
