R workshops in Brisbane Australia, February 2026. 

For many years I had the pleasure of teaching with Ant Richardson and the team for these R workshops. I'm not there anymore, but recommend attending these if you can make the dates:

Transform your research questions into robust statistical insights with our 2026 Summer R Workshops in an immersive exploration of R programming and statistical modelling.
