# Blog Writing Style Guide

This document describes the writing style for blog posts based on analysis of existing posts. Use this guide when writing new blog content or when AI assistants help with blog writing.

## Core Writing Principles

### Voice and Tone
- **First person perspective**: Use "I" freely when sharing personal experiences, opinions, and workflows
- **Conversational but professional**: Write as if explaining to a colleague over coffee
- **Direct and practical**: Get to the point quickly without excessive preamble
- **Honest and reflective**: Share genuine experiences, including uncertainties and limitations
- **Encouraging**: Supportive tone when giving advice, especially to early career researchers
- **Accessible to non-specialists**: When writing for general audiences, use analogies and plain language

### Sentence Structure
- **Active voice preferred**: "I attended a symposium" not "A symposium was attended"
- **Short to medium sentences**: Aim for clarity over complexity
- **Varied sentence length**: Mix shorter punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- **Contractions acceptable**: "I'm", "don't", "it's" are fine and add conversational tone
- **Rhetorical questions**: Use sparingly to engage readers: "Would you consider yourself to be a science communicator?"

### Language Choices
- **Plain language**: Avoid unnecessary jargon; explain technical terms when needed
- **Concrete over abstract**: Use specific examples rather than vague generalizations
- **Minimal qualifiers**: Avoid overuse of "critical", "key", "essential" - just state things directly
- **Technical precision where needed**: Use correct terminology for R packages, software, and methods
- **Vivid analogies**: Use relatable comparisons to explain complex concepts: "Mosaics of habitats are like shops around a village town square"

## Voice Consistency Checklist

When writing or editing a blog post, check:

- [ ] Is the tone conversational but professional?
- [ ] Have I used first person where appropriate?
- [ ] Are sentences clear and direct?
- [ ] Have I included specific examples or data?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged limitations or caveats?
- [ ] Is technical terminology explained or linked?
- [ ] Are code examples complete and working?
- [ ] Have I avoided unnecessary qualifiers?
- [ ] Does the structure match the post type?
- [ ] Would this be helpful to a colleague?

## Examples of Style in Action

### Good: Direct and Personal
"I, of course, want to do everything from the R program, because I'm not great with unix code or Python."

### Good: Honest Caveat
"Now I wouldn't recommend using `--allow-all-tools` like this however. There are important security considerations."

### Good: Practical Specificity
"So aim for projects that need 6 months to a year to complete. Talk to your supervisor about projecting time needed, as we all tend to underestimate that."

### Good: Conversational Transition
"Here's an example in action. I use sprintf to format the terminal command with the prompt, tools and sub-directory path."

### Avoid: Overly Formal
"It is imperative that one considers the security implications prior to implementation."

### Avoid: Vague Generalization
"This is a critical tool that provides key functionality for essential workflows."

### Good: Accessible Analogy
"Mosaics of habitats are like shops around a village town square. A village with just lolly shops would suit my children, but not many others."

### Good: Acknowledging Limitations
"The models focused on overall ecosystem productivity gains, but giant kelp provides additional benefits not captured in these predictions."

### Good: Personal Narrative
"I never got very good marks in writing, but my creative writing teacher (Karen Clark) said something that has stuck in my head all these years."

### Good: Problem Identification
"Most of the really insidious bugs occur in sections of code that use `dplyr` tools and pipes. These are always the types of bugs that don't throw an error, so you get a result, it just turns out to be wrong."

## Special Considerations

### Writing for Different Audiences

**For scientists/technical readers**:
- Use technical terminology appropriately
- Include code examples and mathematical notation
- Reference specific packages, methods, and papers
- Assume familiarity with basic concepts

**For general/public audiences**:
- Use analogies and plain language
- Explain technical terms when first used
- Focus on implications and applications
- Use vivid imagery: "underwater grass", "fish wee and poo"

### Handling Uncertainty and Limitations

- Be explicit about what you don't know: "I haven't read how to choose the 'optimal' value"
- Acknowledge when something is difficult: "This is the hard part that needs a lot of thought"
- State caveats clearly: "A few caveats on my estimate"
- Invite input: "Message me on Twitter if you have seen an example"
- Update posts when you learn more: "(This part is new as of 2020-04-22)"

### Community Engagement

- Acknowledge feedback: "So once this post got shared I got a lot of feedback"
- Credit people who helped: "Roger Bivand wrote to tell me about..."
- Invite discussion: "I will be interested to hear how much time other people spend"
- Provide contact methods: Twitter handles, email addresses
- Share on social media strategically

### Evolution and Updates

- Add dated updates when new information emerges
- Acknowledge when your thinking has changed
- Reference previous posts when building on ideas
- Show learning journey: "I'm starting to see a pattern"

## Final Notes

This style guide captures patterns from existing posts. The style is flexible and adapts to content type, but maintains consistency in:
- Directness and clarity
- Personal voice and honesty
- Practical focus
- Conversational professionalism
- Respect for reader's time
- Accessibility across audiences
- Acknowledgment of collaborators and community

When in doubt, prioritize being helpful and clear over being impressive or comprehensive. Write as if you're explaining to a colleague who wants to learn, not to impress reviewers.
