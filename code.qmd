Feel free to download and share these tutorials. You are welcome to use them for your own teaching, and I would love to hear about it.

There are also many more [blog post length tutorials on our blog](code.qmd). 

The downside is that it is not easy to get started, particularly if you are not simultaneously a geo-statistical expert and a gun programmer. I am trying to make the jump easier for ecologists by providing courses and helpful blog posts here.

More code (including this webpage) is on my [Github page](https://github.com/cbrown5).
