### We work on balancing the conservation of marine ecosystems with human uses of the oceans

Welcome to the lab webpage of Associate Professor Chris Brown from the [Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies, Tasmania](https://discover.utas.edu.au/C.J.Brown).

The future of ocean and coastal biodiversity is uncertain. This uncertainty   threatens humanity's place on the blue planet. We urgently need to adapt human uses of the ocean to conserve its ecosystems and ensure it continues to provide us with  food, energy, recreation, clean water and clean air. 
  
We are marine scientists who use quantitative tools to inform environmental  decisions in the oceans. We do this by bringing ecological complexity to the planning tools used to inform decision making. We work with decision makers to provide quantitative advice on ocean and coastal conservation and fishery  management.  Our tools of choice are computer programming, mathematical models and statistical analysis. These tools allow us to work with complex datasets to find solutions for ocean management.
   
We specialize in the [R programming language](http://cran.r-project.org/) and teach R to others.

Chris' teaching resources are on this site and are [open-access](code.qmd)

## Current projects  

Below are a few key funded current projects. We work on a diverse range of ocean science topics and the list here is not comprehensive.
