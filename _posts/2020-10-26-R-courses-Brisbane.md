# R workshops in Brisbane 2021

Our annual series of popular R workshops is on again between 22nd and 25th June 2021, in person at the University of Queensland.  Over
the past 5 years we've successfully trained hundreds of academics, researchers and students. There are 4 courses that range from
introductory to advanced and focus on applications of R to common types of biological data analysis. We also teach GIS and spatial
analysis in R.

The courses are taught by analysis experts and experienced teachers Ant Richardson (University of Queensland), Rhetta Chappel (Griffith University), Bill Venables (CSIRO), Chris Brown (Griffith University) and Dave Schoeman (University of Sunshine Coast).

We hope to meet in person! But refunds will be available if meeting/travel restrictions prevent that.
