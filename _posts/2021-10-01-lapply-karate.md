Running R code for all combinations of some parameters with lapply karate  
---------------------------------------------  

Sometimes we want to run the same bit of code many times for different
parameters. Then if we have multiple parameters, we may want to run the
code for all combinations of those parameters. I use what I call ‘lapply
karate’ to perform this task.

Applications include in simulating data, simulating data and fitting a
model to test model fit, conducting sensitivity analyses for models or
even making lots of plots.

We’d also like our method to generalize easily to other parameters. So
for instance, once we run the model for all combos of parameter A and B,
we’d also like to run it for all combos of parameters A and C, without
too much more coding.

Options for looping over all combinations of several variables
--------------------------------------------------------------

There are many options for doing this task. Here are some common ones:

`for` or `while` loops (but gets unweildy)

`Vectorize` function (base R) - maybe a bit slow?

Apply family (base R), e.g. lapply, tapply, apply, sapply etc…

`purrr` package (`map` and `pmap` functions)

`data.table` Probably the fastest?

`dplyr` Also very fast

`mclapply` to do same as lapply on multiple threads!

There are different performance considerations with all of above. But
for an introduction I find `sapply` and `lapply` are the most
intuitive\*.

-   But not that intuitive, so read one, but this code is definitely one
    to try yourself.

Function to simulate an autoregressive model.
---------------------------------------------

First, let’s setup a case-study simulation. Below code just simulates
data from an autoregressive model. Try changing to `ar` parameter to see
what happens:

    library(ggplot2)
    theme_set(theme_classic())
    tmax <- 300
    set.seed(42)
    yt <- arima.sim(list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=0.99), n=tmax)
    t <- 1:tmax
    dat <- data.frame(t = t, yt = yt)
    ggplot(dat) +
      aes(x = t, y = yt) +
      geom_line()


![](lapply-karate_files/figure-markdown_strict/cars-1.png) The higher
the `ar` parameter the stronger the deviations in time.

Fitting a model
---------------

We’ll use a GAM to fit a spline to the data we just simulated. Part of
the GAM output is an EDF (Effective Degrees of Freedom) statistic.
Higher values = greater non-linearity. We should see higher values of
the EDF when the AR is greater (because then we get more strong
non-linear deviations from the mean):

    library(mgcv)

    ## Loading required package: nlme

    ## This is mgcv 1.8-31. For overview type 'help("mgcv-package")'.

    m1 <- gam(yt ~ s(t, bs = "ad"),
              data = dat)
    dat$pred <- predict(m1)
    ggplot(dat) +
      aes(x = t, y = yt) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_line(aes(y = pred), col = "red")


![](/images/2021-10-01-lapply-karate/lapply-karate_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)
Black line shows the data, red line shows the GAM fit. You can see the
edf number if you do `summary(m1)`, or we can access the EDF
programmatically like this:

    sum(m1$edf)-1

## lapply karate

Note Pablo García wrote into me after this blog was published. He pointed out that the base
R functions `mapply` and `Map` are setup to be multivariate equivalents of `sapply` and `lapply`.
So you may want to look at those as a slightly more intuitive way of performing the below
computations. 

### Step 1: Setup a function

We need to turn code above into a function, so we can run it many times
for whatever paramter inputs. Here I will vary the random seed,
correlation coef (`rho`) and timeseries length (`tmax`).

    arima_vary <- function(rho, tmax, iseed){
      set.seed(iseed)
      yt <- arima.sim(list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=rho), n=tmax)
      t <- 1:tmax
      dat <- data.frame(t = t, yt = yt)
      m1 <- gam(yt ~ s(t, bs = "ad"),
                data = dat)
      return(sum(m1$edf)-1)
    }

    arima_vary(0.8, 100, 1)

    ## [1] 30.21985

The function returns the EDF from the fitted GAM

### Step 2: Loop over different values of rho

With `sapply` we can run our model for series of rho values:

    rhos <- seq(0.01, 0.99, by = 0.2)
    edfvals <- sapply(rhos, arima_vary, tmax = 100, iseed = 1)
    plot(rhos, edfvals)

![](/images/2021-10-01-lapply-karate/lapply-karate_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

### Step 3: Loop over all combinations of rho and iseed and tmax

What about getting the edf for different combinations of the three
parameters?

First set-up a dataframe of all combos:

    rhos <- seq(0.01, 0.99, by = 0.2)
    seeds <- 1:5
    tmax_vals <- c(100, 200, 400)
    datin <- expand.grid(rho = rhos, iseed = seeds,
                         tmax = tmax_vals)
    nrow(datin)

    ## [1] 75

So we are going to run our simulations 75 times (this can easily get
very large, the larger the df, the longer our simulations will take).

    i <- 1:nrow(datin)

    #one way using sapply
    system.time(
    datin$edfvals <- with(datin,
                    sapply(i, function(j){arima_vary(rho[j], tmax[j], iseed[j])})))

    ##    user  system elapsed
    ##   6.929   0.163   7.460

If it works, don’t forget the [Kiai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiai)

HYAH!

Its a good idea to run it for a small number of combos first and check
how long it will take.

Another way of doing the same thing using apply:

    datin$edfvals <-
                    apply(datin,1, function(j){
                      arima_vary(j["rho"], j["tmax"], j["iseed"])
                      })

The above is the same as doing:

    #Manual way
    arima_vary(datin$rho[1], datin$tmax[1], datin$iseed[1])
    arima_vary(datin$rho[2], datin$tmax[2], datin$iseed[2])
    arima_vary(datin$rho[3], datin$tmax[3], datin$iseed[3])
    #....
    arima_vary(datin$rho[nrow(datin)], datin$tmax[nrow(datin)], datin$iseed[nrow(datin)])

Now we’ve done all that, and saved it as a dataframe, the easiest way to
plot the combinations of parameters is with `ggplot`:

    ggplot(datin) +
      aes(x = rho, y = edfvals, color = iseed) +
      facet_wrap(~tmax) +
      geom_point() +
      stat_smooth()

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

![](/images/2021-10-01-lapply-karate/lapply-karate_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png) We
see greater EDF for greater auto-correlation, as expected, also longer
timeseries length also increases the EDF.

lapply karate
-------------

Now get to `lapply`. `lapply` (for list apply) let’s us have more
complex output. Here I output a dataframe of predictions, rather than
just a single value.

I call it lapply karate, because the trick is how you store the inputs
and outputs to the function. If you’re smart, then you can get
everything to output as dataframes and then its easy to plot all those
simulations with ggplot.

I’ll make a new function first, that outputs the dataframe (and input
parameters, which enables me to save them for use later in ggplot)

    larima_vary <- function(rho, tmax, iseed){
      set.seed(iseed)
      yt <- arima.sim(list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=rho), n=tmax)
      t <- 1:tmax
      dat <- data.frame(t = t, yt = yt)
      m1 <- gam(yt ~ s(t, bs = "ad"),
                data = dat)
      dat$pred <- predict(m1)
      dat$tmax <- tmax
      dat$rho <- rho
      dat$iseed <- iseed
      return(dat)
    }

    # e.g. larima_vary(0.01, 100, 1)

    datout <- with(datin,
                    lapply(i, function(j){larima_vary(rho[j], tmax[j], iseed[j])}))

Now bind all those dataframes (nested in a list), so we can plot them
with ggplot. Below plot shows every GAM fit for each timeseries length
(columns) and each correlation coef (rows).

    library(dplyr)

    ##
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:nlme':
    ##
    ##     collapse

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ##
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ##
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

    datplot <- bind_rows(datout)

    dim(datplot)

    ## [1] 17500     6

    names(datplot)

    ## [1] "t"     "yt"    "pred"  "tmax"  "rho"   "iseed"

    ggplot(datplot) +
      aes(x = t, y = pred, group = iseed) +
      geom_line(alpha = 0.8) +
      facet_grid(rho~tmax, scales = "free")

HYAH!

Other advanced uses
-------------------

You can have your function output a list, so with `lapply` you end up
with a list of lists. Then use `lapply` to extract or plot specific
parts of the list for each object. `purrr` also has some handy functions
for wrangling lists.

You can have more complex inputs to you function, like model formulas,
then the function will run models with different formulas for all
combinations of other inputs.

Check out various packages for parralel computing, to speed things up.
