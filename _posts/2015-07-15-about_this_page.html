<h2> Chris' new Seascape Models webpage </h2>

<p>
Welcome to my new webpage. I got tired of the limitations imposed by my old google sites page. 
I was looking for a new alternative, that would allow me to post my own html and css scripts and 
I stumbled across <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank"> Jekyll </a> for making 
pages hosted on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"> Github</a> (via <a href="http://seananderson.ca/"
target="_blank"> Sean Anderson's</a> excellent
webpage.) </p>
<p>
I hope you find the material on my webpage interesting and useful. 
I have divided posts into <a href ="/Research/index.html">Research</a> posts, that focus 
on short posts summarising my research, and 
<a href ="/Rstats/index.html">Code</a> posts that provide hints and tricks for programming
and data analysis. 
</p>
<p>
Next step: get listed on <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">RBloggers</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Cheers,
Chris</p>
