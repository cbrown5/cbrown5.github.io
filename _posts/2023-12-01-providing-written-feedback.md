# Tips for providing written feedback to students

If
It helps to read some books like Schimel's book on 'writing papers that get cited and grants that get funded' or Steven Pinker 'Sense of Style'. These give you the words to describe what is wrong and how to fix it (before those books I new a sentence could be improved and I knew how to improve it, but I couldn't explain to the student why or how to do it). 

> Just as cooks, musicians and ballplayers have to master some lingo to be able to share their tips and learn from others, so writers can benefit by knowing the names of materials they work with and how they do their jobs.

Then here's the system I've worked out over time
Provide comments on their writing rather than just editing. Explain why it doesn't work and how it can be improved. Below is an example from Jordan's draft
Remember to give positive criticism as well. saying 'good' is ok, but that's harder for the student to interpret. Better to use encouragement like 'After reading this I now understand X for the first time, thankyou!' or 'what helped me understand this was that you broke a complex idea down into several smaller ideas in separate sentences'
Focus on big picture of ideas and overall structure first. Once that is good then narrow in on things like grammar and sentence structure (though sometimes the sentences are so bad you do need to fix those so you can understand what the ideas are)
Therefore I encourage starting with outlines of topic sentences. 
Actually a common problem is not having topic sentences, outlining can help with that
Encourage them to send you lots of small bits of writing often, rather than you spending 2 hours editing a draft once every few months. Lots of small changes are easier to learn than getting dumped with heaps of comments all at once
Notice repeated mistakes and problems and point them out to the student, along with a solution (like Jordan was always writing 'linking with...', rather than using 'however' or 'therefore'). 
Its common that you'll have to show them something several times before they learn. That's just part of the process. 
When they are stressed or time poor they may default back to bad habits, so just talk about that with them when you notice it, like "I noticed you are doing XXX again, what's going on for you right now?"
