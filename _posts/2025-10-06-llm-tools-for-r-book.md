# New book on Large Language Model tools for R

If you're interested in using Large Language Models (LLMs) with R, you should check out Luis D. Verde Arregoitia's new online book: [Large Language Model tools for R](https://luisdva.github.io/llmsr-book/index.html).

The book provides a comprehensive guide to working with LLMs in R, covering packages, techniques, and practical applications.

This is a great complement to my recent posts on [using the ellmer package](https://www.seascapemodels.org/rstats/2025/03/15/LMs-in-R-with-ellmer.html) and [creating tools for LLMs in R](https://www.seascapemodels.org/rstats/2025/03/17/LLMs-in-R-tool-use.html).

If you're looking to integrate AI capabilities into your R workflows, this book is definitely worth exploring.
