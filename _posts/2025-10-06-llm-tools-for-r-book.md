# Resource for using Large Language Model tools in R

If you're interested in using Large Language Models (LLMs) with R, you should check out Luis D. Verde Arregoitia's new online resource: [Large Language Model tools for R](https://luisdva.github.io/llmsr-book/index.html). Its available in English and Spanish. 

The resouce provides a comprehensive guide to working with LLMs in R, covering packages, techniques, and practical applications.

This is a great complement to my [workshop and book](https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/) that guides you through some of the options and prompt engineering for high quality R analyses.

If you're looking to integrate AI capabilities into your R workflows, this book is definitely worth exploring.
