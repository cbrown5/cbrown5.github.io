# Moving to University of Tasmania

I'm pleased to announce I've accepted a new role as Associate Professor of Fisheries Science at the University of Tasmania. I'll be joining the team at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies. 

My new role starts May 2023. 

I'll still be pursuing the same research agenda in ocean management and ecosystem modelling. Most of my research team at Griffith Uni will be staying on at Griffith, so I'll continue to have strong links in south-east Queensland. 

Shoot me an email if you are interested in collaboration opportunities or joining my team as a student at UTas.
