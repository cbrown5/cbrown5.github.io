### Will commercial fishing closures enhance recreational fisheries?  

Recently the Queensland Government has declared several net fishing free zones in bays and estuaries of central and North Queensland. The aim of these zones is to enhance recreational fisheries. However, these zones have been contentious as they will cost commercial fishers, with some likely to lose their jobs.

Also of concern is the lack of scientific assessment to support the closures. I am preparing a paper that attempts to fill this gap where possible and suggests where further work is needed for a proper assessment. The paper is now submitted, but get in touch if you are interested to know more.  

See the [Tangled net](http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2015/s4294087.htm) report from ABC news for more info.
