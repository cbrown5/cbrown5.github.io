# New postdoc and PhD positions on multiple stressors of ecosystems

Professor Rod Connolly (Griffith University), Professor Isabelle Côté (Simon Fraser University) and I will be recruiting a postdoc and a PhD student in 2018 to work on our project "Predicting interactive effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems" [funded by the Australian Research Council](http://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2017/11/10/interacting-impacts-grant.html).

We will advertise officially next year, but feel free to get in touch with me ahead of time (chris.brown@griffith.edu.au) if you are interested in discussing either of these positions.

> The project aims to create an innovative model to predict how multiple stressors interact to affect marine ecosystems across large spatial scales. The interactive effects of multiple stressors are poorly quantified in the marine environment, and natural resource managers are not able to confidently incorporate these complex interactions into prioritizing management efforts in space and time. The project intends to develop models, validated in the field that will predict, a-priori, the type of interactions that may occur. This should enable ecosystem managers to better prioritise actions to more effectively conserve valuable and threatened marine ecosystems.

**For the postdoc position** we are seeking a PhD ecologist who is competent in quantitative methods. The project may include a mix of statistical analysis, numerical modelling and field experiments. We are interested to hear from statistical modellers, numerical modellers or field ecologists who are competent with quantitative analysis (e.g. in R). Local field work is possible for interested candidates. Candidates must have excellent communication skills and a strong track record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals.

The postdoc position is nominally for 2.5 years full-time at academic level A (PhD graduate level); however, these terms are currently flexible. Please get in touch for more information.

**For the PhD position** we are seeking someone interested in the study of threatened marine ecosystems, particularly seagrass meadows, and ecosystem management. Candidates may undertake field work or purely modelling/analytical based work. Candidates must be enthusiastic about the analysis of data and should be keen to learn the R program language if they do not already have skills in this area.

Australian Resident applicants to Griffith's PhD program should have recieved Honours 1 or equivalent. A lead authored publication in a peer-reviewed journal will be helpful.

International applicants to Griffith's PhD program must have led at least one peer-reviewed paper in an internationally recognised journal.
