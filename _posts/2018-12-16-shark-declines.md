# Decline in large shark species on Queensland's coastline  

In [work just published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0233-1) we report extensive declines in large shark species on Queensland's coastline.

[Dr George Roff](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1447) led the study of data from Queensland's shark control program, dating back to the 1960s. We report on declines in hammerhead and white shark catch of 92%, decline in tiger shark catch of 74% and declines in large whaler species of 82%.

Shark attacks are currently a contentious issue in Australia, and many have been calling for increased culls because of a perception that there is a 'plague of sharks'.  Our study finds that large shark numbers are actually at a historical low.

The study ignited a national conversation about shark conservation, with study lead, George Roff, putting in a huge effort to meet as many interview requests as possible.
