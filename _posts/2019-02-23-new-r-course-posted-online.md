# R course in data wrangling and spatial analysis notes are online

I have [posted the notes to our new R course in data wrangling and spatial analysis notes on this webpage](http://www.seascapemodels.org/data/data-wrangling-spatial-course.html).

The course is aimed at biological scientists who have some basic knowledge of R, but want to learn to use it for a broader variety of tasks. It is aimed to show how you can use R as a complete workflow from data cleaning to analysis, graphics and mapping.

We walk through the data wrangling, graphics, analysis and mapping for a case-study analysis of a (real) plankton data-set.

In terms of packages, we cover data-wrangling with dplyr and a little bit of tidyr. Graphics with ggplot2. Then analyses with GLMs and GAMs (mgcv package). Mapping and GIS with raster, ggplot2 and sf. We also cover how you can do spatial analyses with GAMs.

The R course was written for a 1-day workshop at University of Queensland with my colleagues, Ant Richardson, Dave Schoeman and Bill Venables (author of the MASS package among other R fundamentals).

I would guestimate that if you do this course on your own you will need a day or a bit more. It took us a whole day in class, but we skipped a lot of the bonus material.

I hope you find the course helpful.
