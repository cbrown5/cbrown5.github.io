# AI aided note taking

This is my favourite workflow for note taking at the moment: 

1. Voice record my thoughts to iphone with the recording app. I don't take much care to speak clearly or in a structured way. I just blurt all my thoughts out into the recorder. 

2. Press the transcript button and copy the text

Then I either do: 

3a. Paste into Copilot for Teams and prompt `Clean up this voice recording and organize it into notes that are arranged in a logical order. Use markdown format` 

Or 

3b. Paste into Teams chat to myself for later. Later on my laptop paste the text into a markdown document and use Roo Code or Github Copilot with `Clean up this voice recording and organize it into notes that are arranged in a logical order. Use markdown format`

In general I'm not a fan of AI note taking. The problem is if you take a document you didn't write and then get AI to summarize it for you there is no mental energy. The mental energy is when you learn and synthesize ideas. 

However, I feel differently about voice recordings, because the ideas are still going via my brain before they get to the AI. It also allows me to capture complex ideas that I may not get time to write down. 

For example, I've used it while cleaning the house to get a blog idea down and then into a first draft. I used it while walking to an appointment to 'write' a first draft of the methods for a paper.
