# Seeking Research Assistant to assist with programming, GIS and literature reviews in coastal marine science

We are seeking a research assistant to assist with various projects in coastal marine science at Griffith University, Queensland. The person will support our work on the [Global Wetlands Project](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/), among other projects. The RA will join a team of research fellows and PhD students and work in an exciting collaborative environment. There will be opportunities to coauthor publications and contribute to informing ecosystem management on applied projects.

At a minimum we require someone who can work at least 3 days per week, but ideally full-time, for the next 4 months or more.

Key criteria are:

- Some experience in research

- Demonstrate reliability and timeliness

- Demonstrated organisational skills, such as organising meetings and travel.

- Must meet one or more of the desirable criteria below


Desirable criteria

- Experience in GIS

- Experience in advanced R programming (e.g. comfortable with 'for loops' or running GIS in R)

- Experience in literature reviewing and writing


The position can be based at Griffith's Nathan or Gold Coast campuses, but travel between campuses will be required. We are particularly interested to hear from candidates with GIS experience (e.g. storage, management and processing of large spatial data, assisting with spatial analysis).
This position would be ideally suited to honours graduates who want to gain more research experience before considering a PhD or career in research.

Applicants must have an Australian work permit for the duration of employment (e.g. be a citizen, permanent resident).

Please feel free to distribute this to group mailing lists as appropriate.
