# Quick tips for facilitating a good meeting

In roughly chronological order. 

This advice comes from perspective of trying to get contributions from diverse research groups, that often mix career stages and cultural backgrounds. But much of it is useful in any context (e.g. more formal contexts.)

## Before the meeting starts 

**Be prepared.** 

- Try to learn participants names and something about their background. 
- Reflect on expectations participants might have for the meeting these might be in terms of outcomes, but also cultural expectations in terms of behaviour. 
- Set a meeting agenda. Send it around to participants ahead of time. 
- Send them any background reading ahead of time (but keep it short and assume that most haven't read it)
- Designate a note-taker (if needed). You can't facilitate well and take notes. 

Show up early, so you can familiarise yourself with the room set-up. 

If its online, familiarise yourself with the software features before the meeting (where chat box is, where Q&A box is, what people see when you speak, is sharing enabled etc...)

Prepare your introductory and closing notes. 

Check the agenda with someone more experienced if need be - people often try to cram too much into a meeting. One way to save meeting time for discussion is to pre-send reading for the group. 

## Starting the meeting

Come prepared with an opening that will set the scene and topic of the meeting. Remind people of the time slot for the meeting, and its goals. Remind them of expectations e.g. who is speaking, what to do if you disagree (if neccessary). 

As facilitator people will look to you for leadership on how the meeting goes. Your approach will affect: 

- how fast people talk
- whether it is safe to pause between comments, or whether someone grabs that free air space and starts talking
- who overtalks who 
- who talks; if its ok to talk if you are shy or less senior. 

If you don't provide that leadership, then that role will default to the most senior person or the person who talks the most. 

So grab your facilitator role by the reins and show the group how its going to be. 

## During the meeting

Be present. Keep on your toes. By this I mean actually listen to what other people are saying, rather than thinking about what you will say when other people talk. 

### Engaging the participants 

Engaging everyone helps everyone feel heard and helps get contributions from all participants. 

Show other people you are listening: eye contact, nodding, hand gestures. 

Reflect back to people what they've just said. This is active listening. For instance, if Alice described how she was satisified with the progress on the project" you could respond "Thanks Alice, I see that you're happy with how the project is going" (rather than just nodding). 

Draw in people, especially the quiet ones. For instance, if Selena describes an issue she is having with the data analysis on the project you could hand it over to Takuya:
"Takuya, I know you've written about network modelling, do you have experiences from that work you could share to help Selena"

If you don't know their backgrounds that is ok to! You can just ask someone to reflect like:
"Takuya, what do you think about what Selena just said" 
or
"Takuya, can you describe the problem Selena is having in your own words?"

This reflection opportunity can be helpful to engage people, but also see problems from different perspectives. 

If you start asking people to reflect on each other's comments, everyone will pay more attention to what is being said. 

### You don't need to have all the answers!

A common mistake as facilitator is to think you need to answer the questions that are posed. Then the facilitator ends up talking with their own answers. You don't answer them. 

**You are there to help the group find a solution.** So if a problem/question comes up, use your facilitator skills to kick it onto someone else like "Muhammad, what do you think about Maria's question?" 

If the group solves a problem, even if you knew the answer, then you are doing successful facilitation. 

## Dealing with problems 

### People who talk too much

The tactful way is to smoothly transition the conversation away from them, by taking over their sentences. Its hard to put this in text but here goes:

Overtalker: "What I'm talking about is the absolute lack of data in..."
Facilitator (finishes the sentence) "the models. That's a really important insight John. I'd like to pass on to Eva for her perspective on this issue". 

But this is partly highly cultural. e.g. in some cultures the senior members need to be let to speak as much as they want, in other cultures it might be more appropriate to let minority groups speak first. Some cultures this is fast and seamless. Others you would leave a long pause between sentences. 

### People who talk too much in online meetings

This is really difficult. And we all tend to overtalk in online meetings because we aren't getting as much visual feedback from our participants! If you have advice let me know. A couple tips:

- Get cameras turned on so people get more visual feedback. 
- Be engaged, overstate your body language (nodding etc...) so the speaker knows you are listening
- Use emoticons and reactions

Sometimes I just talk over them like in the 'people who talk too much' example. The key thing is to show you've heard by reflecting their thoughts back to them in your own words. If you abruptly change topics it may seem rude. 

### People who don't engage or who are shy

See notes above about engaging particpants. Just try to be aware of who they are and keep a mental checklist of who is doing the talking. 

### Transitioning the conversation

What to do if the conversation is going in the wrong direction, or you are running out of time?

Follow above advice for people who talk too much to transition the conversation to where you want it to go. 

Just remember to acknowledge the person you are taking the platform from. A bad example

"So we are running out of time, let's move on"

Good example:

"Thanks for those important insights Anya. I think we need to follow-up to properly explore those ideas. Now I'd like to just take us back to the agenda..."

### Strong emotions and conflict

Sometimes people express anger, frustration or deep sadness in meetings. Sometimes there is conflict that goes beyond healthy collegial debate. These situations can be difficult and need to be treated case-by-case, particularly if they involve ongoing issues in group dynamics. 

The only general point I can make is to acknowledge the feelings. For example, you could say, "Rachael, are you feeling angry about what was just said?"

This helps the person feel heard. But also helps you take the floor back from the conflict. 

How you go from there depends on the situation. If its sadness (like a colleague drops the news that they lost a friend recently) and you are in a supportive group, you could offer condolences and reflections as a group, just generally show kindness. 

If its serious conflict yuo might like to ask the person to come outside for a private chat (and delegate facilitation to someone else while you are gone). 

I'll leave that there, as I am no expert on conflict resolution. 

## Save time to wrap up and finish on time

Its polite to finish on time. You should aim to finish early, to allow time to wrap up. Also people may have 'last thoughts' just when you were going to finish. For example for a 50 minute meeting start at 11am:

11:35am - Start bringing the conversation back to the agenda
11:40am - Ask for any last thoughts
11:45am - Provide wrap-up, reflection, next steps and actions. 

## Wrapping up 

Save time to wrap-up the meeting. This can include:

- Reflections on key things that were discussed or learned
- Acknowledging different people's contributions
- Thanking people for contributions, especially if they put a lot of effort in (e.g. planning) or brought up something that was emotionally difficult (like sharing a failure that the group can learn from)
- Addressing the agenda items

If it is an action orientated meeting, you should also finish by stating the next steps. 

## Online meetings

I much prefer in-person meetings. Online meetings are more less like conversations and more like he talks, she talks, he talks, she talks. 

Meetings that are simultaneously online and in person are the worst. 

A few tips: 

- Delegate someone to be the 'chat facilitator'. Their job is to keep an eye on the chat and bring any points to your attention. Some people won't or can't talk online and may type instead. So its still good for you as facilitator to raise their points like:
"Ahhh, I see Caitie has asked a great question online, Alyssa she wants to know if..."
- If it is simultaneously online and in person you need an 'online' faciliator to help bring in those people (remind you, monitor chat, perhaps talk to online participants directly)
- Cameras on is better for engagement
- Resist the temptation to check your email when other people are talking (I once did this with screen sharing on, oops). You need to be engaged and staying present. 

## Conclusion

Facilitation is a foundational skill for most careers. But few of us practice it or put much thought into it. It does take practice and commitment to do it well. But its also rewarding to see your team flourish and everyone get more out of meetings.
