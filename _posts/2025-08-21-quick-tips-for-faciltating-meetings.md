# Quick tips for facilitating a good meeting

In roughly chronological order. 

## Before the meeting starts 

Be prepared. 

- Try to learn participants names and something about their background. 
- Reflect on expectations participants might have for the meeting these might be in terms of outcomes, but also cultural expectations in terms of behaviour. 
- Set a meeting agenda. Send it around participants ahead of time. 
- Send them any background reading ahead of time (but keep it short and assume that most haven't read it)

Show up early, so you can familiarise yourself with the room set-up. 

If its online, familiarise yourself with the software features before the meeting (where chat box is, where Q&A box is, what people see when you speak, is sharing enabled etc...)

Prepare your introductory and closing notes. 

## Starting the meeting

Come prepared with an opening that will set the scene and topic of the meeting. Remind people of the time slot for the meeting, and its goals. Remind them of expectations e.g. who is speaking, what to do if you disagree (if neccessary). 

## During the meeting

Be present. Keep on your toes. By this I mean actually listen to what other people are saying, rather than thinking about what you will say

### Engaging the participants 

This helps everyone feel heard and helps get contributions from all participants. 

Show other people you are listening: eye contact, nodding, hand gestures. 

Reflect back to people what they've just said. This is active listening. For instance, if Alice described how she was satisified with the progress on the project" you could respond "Thanks Alice, I see that you're happy with how the project is going" (rather than just nodding). 

Draw in people, especially the quiet ones. For instance, if Selena describes an issue she is having with the data analysis on the project you could hand it over to Takuya:
"Takuya, I know you've written about network modelling, do you have experiences from that work you could share to help Selena"

If you don't know their backgrounds that is ok to! You can just ask someone to reflect like:
"Takuya, what do you think about what Selena just said" 
or
"Takuya, can you describe the problem Selena is having in your own words?"

This reflection opportunity can be helpful to engage people, but also see problems from different perspectives. 

### You don't need to have all the answers!

A common mistake as facilitator is to think you need to answer the questions that are posed. Then the facilitator ends up talking with their own answers. You don't answer them. 

**You are there to help the group find a solution.** So if a problem/question comes up, user your facilitator skills to kick it onto someone else like "Muhammad, what do you think about Maria's question?" 

If the group solves a problem, even if you knew the answer, then you are doing successful facilitation. 

## Dealing with problems 

### People who talk too much

This is highly cultural. e.g. in some cultures the senior members need to be let to speak as much as they want, in other cultures it might be more appropriate to let minority groups speak first. 

The tactful way is to smoothly transition the conversation away from them, by taking over their sentences like. Its hard to put this in text but here goes:

Overtalker: "What I'm talking about is the absolute lack of data in..."
Facilitator (finishes the sentence) "the models. That's a really important insight John. I'd like to pass on to Eva for her perspective on this issue". 

Again this is cultural. Some cultures this is fast and seamless. Others you would leave a long pause between sentences. 

#### People who talk too much in online meetings

This is really difficult. And we all tend to overtalk in online meetings because we aren't getting as much visual feedback from our participants! If you have advice let me know. A couple tips:

- Get cameras turned on so people get more visual feedback. 
- Be engaged, overstate your body language (nodding etc...) so the speaker knows you are listening
- Use emoticons and reactions

Sometimes I just talk over them like in the 'people who talk too much' example. The key thing is to show you've heard by reflecting their thoughts back to them in your own words. If you abruptly change topics it may seem rude. 

#### People who don't engage or who are shy

See notes above about engaging particpants. Just try to be aware of who they are and keep a mental checklist of who is doing the talking. 


## Save time to wrap up and finish on time
