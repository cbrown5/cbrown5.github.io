# Prompting large language models for quality ecological statistics

Announcing a new [pre-print on prompt engineering for ecological statistics.](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9493/). https://doi.org/10.32942/X2CS80

The pre-print describes the challenges and opportunities of using large language models and agents to do ecological statistics. It then goes onto describe some prompt engineering strategies that can help you make the most of these tools, but still get reliable statistical advice and code. 

The pre-print accompanies [a one day course](https://www.seascapemodels.org/R-llm-workshop/index.html#summary) I've published that teaches how to use LLM tools for R and statistics, as well as discussing the environmental and ethical challenges.
