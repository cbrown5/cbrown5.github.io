# New vlog Conservation Hackers

I haven't been writing blog posts for a while because I have been spending my time on a new project: [the Conservation Hackers vlog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSH4ctGD-waPSI_4w6PlTBg/videos).

I wanted to be able to share the interesting conversations I have with scientists and get the stories behind the research papers. I'm especially interested in making the connection to real world impact on the conservation of ecosystems.

I'm currently experimenting with a number of different vlog formats, including [shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/M_8JOxNFPPE), [how to videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbdE0ZPvnTU) and [interviews with leading conservation scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcx90O309zQ).

So head over to YouTube, check out some content and leave me a comment to let me know what you like.
