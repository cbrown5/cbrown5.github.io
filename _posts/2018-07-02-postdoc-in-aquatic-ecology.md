# Postdoctoral job in Aquatic Ecology

I am seeking a postdoctoral fellow in Aquatic Ecology to work on wetlands science and environmental accounting with Dr Mark Kennard, Professor Rod Connolly and I.
This is a 2 year position.

Applications close 30th July. [Apply here](https://ps-jobs.griffith.edu.au/psc/CAREERS/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?FOCUS=Applicant&Page=HRS_APP_JBPST&Action=U&FOCUS=Applicant&SiteId=100&JobOpeningId=109379&PostingSeq=1), read more below or in the [position description](Read more [here](/data/00058808_PD.pdf) (links to a pdf).

**The Project**

This project will develop an economic-environmental accounting approach that will provide clear performance metrics to help inform development and conservation of aquatic habitats. The environmental accounts will help inform water planning and management of coastal wetland ecosystems. The project partners two major programs run by the Australian Rivers Institute.
The first, is a consortium of organisations, including the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University, who are involved in research under the National Environmental Science Program (NESP) Northern Australia Environmental Resources Hub. NESP Hub partners undertake research to support sustainable development of Australia’s unique northern environments. The Australian Rivers Institute is currently running two complementary projects through the NESP Hub on environmental economic accounting and environmental flow management in northern Australia’s river catchments.   

The second program is the new Global Wetlands research program, which is developing and applying globally applicable assessments of coastal wetland health to drive actions and investments towards protection, restoration and improvement of coastal wetlands worldwide. Coastal wetlands – mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh – are valuable ecosystems with high biodiversity. However as the world’s coastal cities continue to grow and industrialise, many coastal wetlands are facing major declines in ecosystem health.   

To accomplish the programs’ objectives, the Institute is recruiting a research fellow who has a productive publication record and is skilled in the synthesis of ecological data. The research fellow will synthesise existing research on environmental flows and wetland health in Northern Australia. They will use the synthesis to inform a new approach to economic-environmental accounting, developed in collaboration with a team that includes economists and social scientists. Finally, they will work with the GIS experts in the Global Wetlands program to apply the accounting approach to report on the health of coastal wetlands at a global scale.   

This is an opportunity to be part of major initiatives promoting the health of key aquatic ecosystems. The research fellow will work in a supportive team with complementary skills in ecology, economics, social science, statistical modelling, big data, and science communication.

**The Role**

The Postdoctoral Research Fellow will work closely with project Chief Investigators and colleagues in the Australian Rivers Institute. The Postdoctoral Research Fellow will be required to actively contribute to these research projects, and as a member of the Australian Rivers Institute, to broader Institute activities.  The role will require high level skills in aquatic ecology, data analysis, stakeholder engagement and communications writing.
This is a 2 year, full time position, located at either the Gold Coast or Nathan campuses, however flexible working arrangements may be negotiated.

**The person**

The successful applicant will have completed a PhD in aquatic ecology, have demonstrated skills in synthesis of ecological data and be enthusiastic about interdisciplinary collaboration. They will have published lead authored papers in esteemed journals, and have excellent interpersonal and communication skills with the ability to work effectively within a team.

Griffith University values gender equality, diversity and inclusion and is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to persons from all backgrounds and identities.
