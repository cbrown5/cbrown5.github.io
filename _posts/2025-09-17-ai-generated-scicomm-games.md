# AI generated scicomm games

This week I ran a talk and workshop for the Tasmanian Student Science Communicators Network.

The workshop was about creating gamifying learning. So I thought it would be fun to design some games then create them live as web apps using an AI agent. 

The particpants designed games on a piece of paper. The aim was to communicate different concepts about sustainable management of fisheries through a game.

I then took the images and a simple description of game play and plugged it into the Roo Code AI agent. 

Here's the results, they are simple html and javascript based games. 

Thanks to the workshop participants for generously contributing their ideas.

Here's the game rules (which incidentally are also the prompts I used)

## Fish crush

In this game the player is working to replenish the fish population and racing a truck that is taking fish out of the ocean.

The ocean is the top bucket.

The bottom bucket is like candy candy crush. The player is trying to match four symbols. Every time they match a symbol new fish are born and top-up the fish in the ocean. 

The game ends if the the ocean runs out of fish. 
If the player gets the fish over 80% full then the truck speeds up. 

## Fish in a pond 

In this game the player is to make a large amount of money. They are working to look after fish in a pond, then they catch the fish to make money. 

They are aiming to keep the pond at about 50% full and have a profitable fishery. 

They have to look after the environment around the pond so the fish are healthy. This means preventing pollution and making sure the water is good. 

They can catch fish to make money. If they catch too many fish the population collapses. 

Winning the game should require looking after the environment around the pond. It should also require catching fish at a slow steady rate, not too much, not too litte.
