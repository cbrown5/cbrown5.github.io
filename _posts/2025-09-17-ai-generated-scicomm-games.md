# AI generated scicomm games

This week I ran a talk and workshop for the Tasmanian Student Science Communicators Network.

The workshop was about creating gamifying learning. 

The particpants designed games on a piece of paper. The aim was to communicate different concepts about sustainable management of fisheries through a game.

I then took the images and a simple description of game play and plugged it into the Roo Code AI agent. 

Here's the results, they are simple html and javascript based games
