# R tools and packages for ecological data analysis

Over the years I've developed a collection of R courses, tutorials and blog posts that cover the tools and packages I find most useful for ecological data analysis. Whether you're just getting started with R or looking to expand your skills in spatial analysis, statistical modeling, or data visualization, these resources can help.

The collection includes:

- **Short courses** on topics like spatial analysis, data wrangling with the tidyverse, and predictive ecological modeling
- **Tutorials** on GAMs, GLMs, structural causal models, and more
- **Blog posts** with practical tips and tricks for R programming

Many of these resources are open-access and free to use. They cover everything from data cleaning and visualization to advanced statistical methods and spatial analysis techniques.

**Check out the full collection on my [Code page](/code.html)**

Whether you're working on conservation science, marine ecology, or another field that requires quantitative analysis, I hope you find these tools useful. Feel free to use them for your own learning or teaching - and if you do, I'd love to hear about it!

If you have suggestions for additional topics you'd like to see covered, or have found other useful R tools for ecological work, please [let me know on Twitter](http://twitter.com/bluecology/).
