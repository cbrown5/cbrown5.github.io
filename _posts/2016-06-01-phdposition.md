### PhD position on fisheries dependence on marine habitats

Sustaining fisheries is important for economies, livelihoods and human health, but globally numerous fisheries are threatened by rapid loss of aquatic habitat. The role of habitat in fishery declines is poorly quantified, and we need new models that integrate existing datasets to attribute change in a fishery to change in its habitats.

I have recently been funded by the Australian Research Council to study fisheries and their habitats. The project comes with a fully funded PhD position, so I am seeking motivated candidates.  

The PhD project itself is flexible but may include analysis of coral reef datasets to understand how fishery species relate to their habitats and/or field work to quantify fishery-habitat relationships.  

I am looking for someone who is motivated by conservation issues and is keen on ecological science, improving resource management and marine conservation.
