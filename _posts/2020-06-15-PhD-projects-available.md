# PhD projects available

Our lab uses quantitative tools, including statistics, AI and numerical models, to help conservation managers address a range of issue facing marine ecosystems. Below are two current projects where we are recruiting students.

## Conservation and restoration of coastal habitats
Work with the team on [Global Wetlands Project](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/) to help solve pressing challenges for conservation of coastal wetland habitats. PhD and Honours projects available to work on predicting the impact of multiple interacting stressors and assessing the impact of habitat loss on the sustainability of fisheries. Email Chris (chris.brown@griffith.edu.au) for more information. PhD and honours projects available.

## How can marine conservation recover from the COVID pandemic

Many marine conservation initiatives are supported by ecotourism, but that industry has been hit hard by COVID19 and travel restrictions. PhD projects are available to work with international agencies to understand how conservation of marine life has been affected and plan recovery strategies. Contact Chris Brown (chris.brown@griffith.edu.au) for more information. PhD and honours projects available.

## Criteria for potential PhD applicants

Please consider the below criteria before contacting us. We will not be considering students for applications that do not meet these criteria, because they will not be competitive for funded positions. Further details on Griffith University’s application process can be found [here](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research-study/apply).  

Our primary research methods are quantitative tools. Potential applicants should have either experience in quantiative methods like R, or a very strong desire to learn more quantitative skills. Chris does not supervise projects that are primarily field or lab based, except as cosupervisor with other group leaders.

Our students come with training in a diverse range of fields, including field ecology, maths and IT. Our lab group is outstanding at supporting quantitative training and current PhD students have ample opportunities to learn quantitative skills by working with their peers, postdoctoral researchers, Chris and through specialized training courses.

### Australian students

Australian citizens and permanent residents should have been awarded a 1st Class Honours degree or equivalent (e.g. Masters by research) in a relevant field.

### International students

International applicants must have been awarded a 1st Class Honours degree or equivalent (e.g. Masters with a 40 credit point research thesis) in a relevant field. They must be lead author on at least one publication in an internationally recognized peer-reviewed journal. To be considered, journals should be internationally recognized, for instance they should have an Impact Factor rating from ISI or be listed by Scimago.
