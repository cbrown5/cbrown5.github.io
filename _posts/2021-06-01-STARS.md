Comparison of terra and stars packages
======================================

[The other day I wrote a comparison of raster and terra
packages](https://www.seascapemodels.org/rstats/2021/05/28/terra-raster-comparison.html).
The other newish raster package on the block is stars. So I go through
the same code here.

If you are starting out with stars, [read their manual
first](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/articles/).

But first some key differences.

stars is set-up to work with spatio-temporal arrays (terra also has
better capacity to work with multilayer rasters than raster did). stars
deals with more complex data types than either raster or terra, for
instance, stars can handle [rotated
grids](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/articles/stars4.html).

stars works will with `sf`, and many `sf` functions have methods for
stars objects (like `st_bbox` and `st_transform`). In contrast, my
current experience of trying to use `terra` and `sf` is a bit more
awkward. I had to do lots of class conversions of `terra` objects to
`sf` objects and back again.

stars isn’t as well documented as `raster` or `terra`. Some colleagues
told me they’ve had unresolvable issues with `stars` and reverted to
`raster`. I don’t know the details though.

[There is a ‘babel’ for stars to raster function names
though](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stars/vignettes/stars6.html).

Data reading and plotting in stars
----------------------------------

Data input and plots are quite similar to `sf`:

    library(stars)
    r <- read_stars("data-for-course/spatial-data/MeanAVHRRSST.grd")
    plot(r)

![](/images/2021-06-01-STARS-terra-comparison/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

    st_bbox(r)

    ##   xmin   ymin   xmax   ymax
    ##  82.50 -72.25 181.25  -9.75

Now let’s crop and reproject it, it looks almost identical to
reprojecting a polygon in `sf`:

    #create an extent object
    ext2 <- st_bbox(r)

    #constrain it in x direction
    ext2[1] <- 120
    ext2[3] <- 170

    r2 <- st_crop(r, ext2)

    r3 <- st_transform(r2, "+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0")

    plot(r3)

How do terra, raster and stars compare for speed?
-------------------------------------------------

Let’s compare the three packages for speed at projecting data, an often
time-consuming task.

    library(microbenchmark)

    r_terra <- terra::rast("data-for-course/spatial-data/MeanAVHRRSST.grd")
    r_raster <- raster::raster("data-for-course/spatial-data/MeanAVHRRSST.grd")

    robin_proj <- "+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0"

    tout <- microbenchmark(
    raster::projectRaster(r_raster, crs=robin_proj),
    terra::project(r_terra, robin_proj),
    st_transform(r, crs = robin_proj),
    times = 10
    )
    tout

    ## Unit: milliseconds
    ##                                               expr       min        lq
    ##  raster::projectRaster(r_raster, crs = robin_proj) 330.49234 348.60983
    ##                terra::project(r_terra, robin_proj)  66.47145  67.78466
    ##                  st_transform(r, crs = robin_proj)  19.03904  19.91101
    ##       mean    median        uq       max neval
    ##  506.93616 505.29937 521.27790 874.32388    10
    ##   69.90088  68.87271  69.09739  80.66674    10
    ##   23.38595  20.64656  22.88241  42.57163    10

So `terra` was about 8.5 times faster than `raster` and `stars` was
about 3 times faster than `terra` (so about 26 times faster than
`raster`).

Will stars be compatible with other packages I use?
------------------------------------------------------

The answer here obviously depends on what packages you want to use. A
key one for me is tmap for mapping:

    library(tmap)
    tm_shape(r) +
      tm_raster()

Apparently you can `coerce` stars objects into raster objects, but I
couldn’t figure out easily how to do that (with the 10 minutes I had to
find out).

Summary
-------

Its a confusing world of raster packages now, with raster, terra and
stars all viable options. A decision about your ‘go to’ package needs
more exploration than my brief blog and will depend on what types of
operations you are doing.

The real test will come when analyzing large and complex datasets, so
I’m interested to hear from folk how they go with this.
