# Dr Alyssa Giffin
![](/images/people/alyssa-giffin.jpg)  

Alyssa joined us for her PhD studies after completing her MSc in Tropical Marine Biology and Ecology at James Cook University in Townsville. She completed her PhD in 2023. 

Alyssaâ€™s PhD thesis "Marine and coastal ecosystem-based adaptation" looked at how coastal ecosystems can be used to help communities adapt to climate change. Her chapters included systematic literature review, spatial planning and modelling. Alyssa's research was part of the [Global Wetlands Project](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/), and she was supervised by [Prof. Rod Connolly](http://www.rodconnolly.com/) and Dr Chris Brown.
