# Global Wetlands Project

[This international collaboration lead by Dr Chris Brown, Professor Rod Connolly and Dr Fernanda Adame](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/). It includes a team of more than 15 researchers and students

The Global Wetlands Project (GLOW) elevates scientific understanding of critical issues facing coastal wetlands and builds online tools to help address these issues.

The world needs coastal wetlands. Seagrass meadows, mangrove forests and saltmarshes are high-value habitats providing many benefits to humanity.

Unfortunately, we’re losing these important places. There’s an urgent need to limit and reverse the loss of coastal wetlands in order to arrest biodiversity decline, protect communities and tackle climate change.
