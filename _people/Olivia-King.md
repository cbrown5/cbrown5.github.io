# Olivia King
![](/images/people/olivia-king.jpg)

Olivia was awarded her PhD in 2023.  She has a background in ecotoxicology, water quality, the derivation of Water Quality Guidelines for pesticides in aquatic ecosystems and environmental pollution incidents. Olivia has completed both, her Bachelor of Science (Marine and Wildlife Biology) and Honours (Ecotoxicology) degrees at Griffith University on the Gold Coast.

Olivia’s PhD research focused on the combined and interactive effects of three water quality stressors common to the Great Barrier Reef. Specifically, Olivia aimed to understand if ecotoxicological models can predict the effects of photosystem II-inhibiting herbicide exposure, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) enrichment and reduced light (due to excess suspended sediment) on marine microalgae. Olivia’s PhD was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Stipend Scholarship and an ARC Discovery Project grant.

Olivia was supervised by Dr Christopher Brown and Dr Jason van de Merwe.
