# Caitie Kuempel

Dr Kuempel is a Lecturer in Ecological Modelling at Griffith Univeristy (Brisbane, Australia). She leads the [Conservation Action Team](https://cdkuempel.github.io/website/). 

She is an experienced spatial modeler of environmental impact across a range of human activities and scales. These models can be used to quantify patterns and potential impacts on humans and nature, assess trade-offs between management actions, and develop systematic conservation plans.
