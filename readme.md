# Code for Chris Brown's lab webpage

My personal webpage, view at [https://www.seascapemodels.org](https://www.seascapemodels.org)

Made with [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)


## Instructions for creating blogs

1. Make a new folder in the posts directory
2. Add a index.qmd or index.md in that folder
3. Write the post
5. In the terminal use `quarto preview` to re-render just the changes

In the terminal use `quarto render` to re-render the entire site, which updates links etc... 


TODO

Investigate making r blogs in other dir then just brining over the .md and figure files, might be simpler as then I should be able to just render preview? 
Then push docs to github and change pages settings. 
Then clear repo history

test then UPdate Rbloggers link
