# Code for Chris Brown's lab webpage

My personal webpage, view at [https://www.seascapemodels.org](https://www.seascapemodels.org)

Made with [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)


## Instructions for creating blogs

1. Make a new folder in the posts directory
2. Add a index.qmd or index.md in that folder
3. Write the post
5. In the terminal use `quarto preview` to re-render just the changes

In the terminal use `quarto render` to re-render the entire site, which updates links etc... 


TODO

sort out main vs master branch. Currently got docs on main? 
Then push docs to github and change pages settings. 
Then clear repo history


Investigate making r blogs in other dir then just brining over the .md and figure files, might be simpler as then I should be able to just render preview? 

test then UPdate Rbloggers link
