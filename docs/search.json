This project will integrate multiple lines of evidence to test for a system-wide productivity change that spans shelf and coastal reef ecosystems. The project’s findings have implications for the management of fisheries and conservation of south-east marine ecosystems. Several studies independently point to productivity declines in different south-east marine ecosystems. This project will integrate data from trawl fisheries, reef surveys and macroalgal productivity estimates to ask if these disparate trends share a common driver. The project will use ecosystem modelling tools to ask if fishing and climate are causing system wide change in productivity."

In contrast to existing frameworks for marine ecosystem management, they synthesize and analyse natural, social, and economic factors. Their primary aim is to inform ecosystem management by integrating scientific data to support decision-making processes. With increasing activities in Australian marine territory, there is a growing concern about potential threats to marine ecosystems. A multi-sectoral approach is essential for identifying and prioritizing risks to the environmental and social outcomes associated with emerging ocean industries, such as aquaculture and renewable energy. This integrated approach can help assess how human activities impact ecosystems and guide measures to achieve triple-bottom-line outcomes."

    "text": "How statistics help us get causation right\nStatistics are often maligned. People can play with numbers to bias the way we interpret reality. Or we can find reasons why two events happened at the same time without any real evidence. As the old adage goes, ‘correlation isn’t causation’. But proper use of statistics plays a crucial role in the advancement of knowledge.\n\n\n\nOur brains are prone to making up stories to explain chance events. I was lucky to spot this woodpecker on an exceptionally warm day. Next time it is warm, I will be prone to expecting more woodpeckers.\n\n\nOur human brains have an impressive but limited capacity to detect patterns in nature. We can be very good at finding patterns in nature, for instance, an experienced birder can easily look at a woodland and tell you what types of birds might be found there. But our ability to detect patterns is also very biased. We are very good at detecting some patterns, too good in fact, whereas other patterns we find very difficult to learn.\nI was recently reading Daniel Kahneman’s book ’Thinking, Fast and Slow. Kahneman was awarded a Nobel prize for his work on behavioural economics.\nKahneman describes how our brain uses ‘heuristics’ to detect patterns in nature, and make predictions. Sometimes these heuristics can rapidly generate good predictions, but they can also be strongly biased.\nOne skill we are particularly bad at is regression. Consider the figure. Maybe you have been going out and counting birds across different times. You think this bird likes warm days, so you will see more of them when it is hotter. In the first figure, there is a correlation between bird abundance and temperature (and by implication, warm days cause more birds to be out and about). However, without plotting this data and perhaps fitting a regression, we would have a hard time detecting this pattern.\n\n\n\nOur brains are prone to missing real correlations but then interpreting extreme chance events, like the red point, as causation\n\n\nIn the second figure there is no correlation, but one point stands out as being exceptionally warm and also having a great abundance of birds. We are likely to recall this exceptional event and make a up story about why that happened. Effectively, we would attribute causation without even correlation.\nKahneman goes so far as to suggest a method for ‘mental regression’ if we are trying to predict the outcome of one event, based on another.\nSay tomorrow is predicted to be very hot, and you want to estimate the number of birds you might see. We are likely to overestimate the number, because our normal mental heuristic will think ‘hot = more birds’, so ‘very hot = more birds than ever’. But, this heuristic doesn’t account for the large amount of variation in bird numbers not related to temperature (see the figure). For instance, some days a flock of birds might by chance be hanging around, inflating our counts.\nThe mental regression technique works like this:\nFirst estimate the average number of birds you might count on any day, say 20. Then determine your best guess based on intuition, the number you would expect based on it being very hot. Now guess the correlation between temperature and birds, say 40%. Finally, move 40% of the way from the average abundance toward your first best guess.\nWe can avoid the pitfalls of our mental heuristics if we use techniques like mental regression. When we can collect data, statistics provides us with the tools to find hidden patterns and avoid the pitfalls of intuitive thinking. Science, and the advancement of knowledge depends on robust statistics. To paraphrase the old adage: Correlation isn’t always causation, but chance events aren’t even correlation."

The interviewers, who were six esteemed leaders in business, academia and sport, plus the Governor of Tasmania himself.

The study’s lead, George Roff, anticipated a lot of media interest in the paper, because of concern in Australia about shark attacks.\nIn fact there was a shark attack the very week that our paper was published. Our concern was that we would be drawn into a contentious debate about whether shark culls were an effective means to prevent shark attacks on beaches. Many people believe that we should be trying to wipe out sharks.\nGeorge’s approach to interviews with the media demonstrated all the abilities in leadership I’ve described above.\nHe approached the media interviews with a strong sense of purpose - the media attention was the opportunity he had been seeking to raise awareness about how some of Australia’s iconic shark populations are threatened with extinction. So George directed the interviews towards discussing shark conservation in a reasoned and calm way.\nHe was also able to take the perspective of the general public and interviewers and understand that their would be considerable interest (and potentially anger) about shark attacks. George knew that many media outlets would be seeking a shark attack angle, so he had to work with this perspective in order to get his message out there.\nHowever, he nicely dealt with these contentious questions by sticking to his key message (the study was about shark conservation, not shark attacks). He was also ready for questions about specific shark attacks, and deflected them by talking generally about technologies for shark safety that don’t require killing sharks.\nYou can judge for yourself how he did. Needless to say, he was busy for 3 full days doing interviews everywhere from local radio to national TV."

    "section": "",
    "text": "By Max Campbell\nCollecting accurate data about catch and bycatch in fisheries is of great importance for managing fish stocks and preventing overfishing into the future.\nCurrently, most available catch data comes from reported catch from vessel logbooks. This data has obvious limitations including: ease of reporting, lack of expertise in identifying catch, and conflicts of interest. These limitations could lead to biased catch and bycatch records.\nTrained onboard human observers can address many of the potential biases in the catch recorded on fishing vessels, however, they are expensive and limited in supply. Instead, electronic monitoring (EM) offers a an opportunity to collect more accurate catch data on these fishing vessels.\nIn our paper (Brown et al. 2021 Marine Policy) we used a combination of logbook, human observers, and EM data from Palau, Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands longline fishing vessels, to investigate differences among these methods. Further, we also describing complex patterns found catch and bycatch using advanced statistical methods.\nWe worked with The Nature Conservancy, who over a number of years have been helping these nations pilot electronic monitoring of their fisheries.\nDealing with catch data collected multiple methods in a multi-country setting has its challenges. This project required a great deal of care when processing the data, which was overcome by multiple researchers in our team performing detailed interrogations of the data.\nWe found that the retained catch reported in logbooks was up to three times lower than the retained catch reported by human observers and EM, and there was a lower species diversity reported in logbooks. Concerningly, we also found many discards were usually not reported in logbooks (including several threatened species such as several marine turtles).\nFurther, analysis of EM data revealed some previously undocumented correlations among several key catch and bycatch species in the fishery, that were likely induced by specific fishing practices (like use of certain types of bait).\nWe found that EM and Observer catch records were comparable, thus, EM may provide a suitable alternative to human observers. Where EM data seemed to provide a much more comprehensive representation of species composition and a more accurate catch data than the logbook records."

Then beware, the search engine is controlling, or at least strongly influencing, who you will cite.\nGoogle scholar has become increasingly useful and dominant in helping us find the papers we need. Among its most useful features are instant links to open access pdfs, where available, and ‘updates’ that recommend papers to you based on your own publications and the types of things you search for (see image). To get the updates you need to have a Google Scholar profile page, which most of us seem to these days. When searching you can also click directly to an authors profile page to see what other work they have published.\n\n\n\nGoogle scholar recommended these two papers to me, effectively predicting the paper I am working on before it has even been submitted (They are both great reads by the way)\n\n\nI recently wondered how searches on Google Scholar are ordered. If your paper comes out on top for popular key word searches, like ‘climate change’, you are much more likely to get read and therefore cited. I don’t have quantitative evidence for an effect of search rankings on cites, but there is plenty of circumstantial evidence for it.\nOrdering really matters, because even diligent researchers are unlikely to look through many search pages before trying another search. Numerous studies have shown we are most likely just to click the top result on web searches. That is why there is a whole industry based around search engine optimisation.\nIt is not totally transparent how Google Scholar searchers are ordered. On other platforms, like Web of Science, the search algorithm is transparent. The user gets to decide on which fields are searched (e.g. just the title, or the keywords, or whole topics) and ordering is also user controlled - you can order by date or citations. Therefore, if you use Web of Science, you may bias your reading (and cites) to newer or more highly cited papers. But at least you know that bias exists.\nGoogle Scholar’s algorithm is opaque, so we don’t know how it is biasing our citation practices. You can find some useful help on the search engine here. Of course they don’t tell you exactly how searches are ordered, otherwise people would game the system.\n[Authors note: after I published this blog Rich Grenyer sent me a link to this article from 2009 where some folk tried to reverse engineer how Google Scholar ranks searches. I recommend reading it if you use GS!]\n\n\n\nThe ordered of Google scholar search results is not that obvious, this one seems to be sorted by a mix of citations and keywords\n\n\nFor instance, see the image for the search ‘marine reserves and climate change’. The ordering is not consistently by citations, date or appearance of keywords in the title. The top four hits go from 2003 - 2007 - 2009 then back to 2006. Their citations vary from 2718, to 833 to 188 then back up to 1324. In fact, the ordering is determined by an algorithm that is trying to guess what you are most likely to click on.\nI doubt even Google’s coders could fully explain how searches are ordered. Machine learning algorithms, that try to guess what user wants are often so complex as to be opaque even to their developers. Standard Google searches rank pages based on ‘over 200 factors’. We can only assume Google Scholar does something similar. Presumably it ranks articles, in addition to relevance of your keywords, based on authors, citations, date, credibility of source, your location, articles you cite and so on.\nBack to academia, do we really want citations - one of our key measures of publication ‘quality’ - to be controlled by an algorithm run by a private company?\nAs an example, image the location of your IP address is used in determining the order of searches (it seems to play a role in the recommendations at least - the two articles recommended to me are both studies done in my home state). This would bias you toward local studies and you may miss cross-pollination of important ideas from other regions.\nI don’ think so. So while Google Scholar is convenient, I wouldn’t recommend you use it as your sole search engine. Ultimately, you want to have control over what you find and end up citing."

If your paper comes out on top for popular key word searches, like ‘climate change’, you are much more likely to get read and therefore cited. I don’t have quantitative evidence for an effect of search rankings on cites, but there is plenty of circumstantial evidence for it.\nOrdering really matters, because even diligent researchers are unlikely to look through many search pages before trying another search. Numerous studies have shown we are most likely just to click the top result on web searches. That is why there is a whole industry based around search engine optimisation.\nIt is not totally transparent how Google Scholar searchers are ordered. On other platforms, like Web of Science, the search algorithm is transparent. The user gets to decide on which fields are searched (e.g. just the title, or the keywords, or whole topics) and ordering is also user controlled - you can order by date or citations. Therefore, if you use Web of Science, you may bias your reading (and cites) to newer or more highly cited papers. But at least you know that bias exists.\nGoogle Scholar’s algorithm is opaque, so we don’t know how it is biasing our citation practices. You can find some useful help on the search engine here. Of course they don’t tell you exactly how searches are ordered, otherwise people would game the system.\n[Authors note: after I published this blog Rich Grenyer sent me a link to this article from 2009 where some folk tried to reverse engineer how Google Scholar ranks searches. I recommend reading it if you use GS!]\n\n\n\nThe ordered of Google scholar search results is not that obvious, this one seems to be sorted by a mix of citations and keywords\n\n\nFor instance, see the image for the search ‘marine reserves and climate change’. The ordering is not consistently by citations, date or appearance of keywords in the title. The top four hits go from 2003 - 2007 - 2009 then back to 2006. Their citations vary from 2718, to 833 to 188 then back up to 1324. In fact, the ordering is determined by an algorithm that is trying to guess what you are most likely to click on.\nI doubt even Google’s coders could fully explain how searches are ordered. Machine learning algorithms, that try to guess what user wants are often so complex as to be opaque even to their developers. Standard Google searches rank pages based on ‘over 200 factors’. We can only assume Google Scholar does something similar. Presumably it ranks articles, in addition to relevance of your keywords, based on authors, citations, date, credibility of source, your location, articles you cite and so on.\nBack to academia, do we really want citations - one of our key measures of publication ‘quality’ - to be controlled by an algorithm run by a private company?\nAs an example, image the location of your IP address is used in determining the order of searches (it seems to play a role in the recommendations at least - the two articles recommended to me are both studies done in my home state). This would bias you toward local studies and you may miss cross-pollination of important ideas from other regions.\nI don’ think so. So while Google Scholar is convenient, I wouldn’t recommend you use it as your sole search engine. Ultimately, you want to have control over what you find and end up citing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Writing grants takes time and effort, but how much time? In this post I’ll show data from my time tracking app that quantifies exactly how much time it took me to write applications to a national grant agency (the Australian Research Council).\nTLDR: I start preparing 4-5 months ahead of the final deadline, spend about 10% of my work hours over that period. But effort varies and peaks at 30% of my monthly work hours 1-2 months before the deadline.\nI hope this post helps other people plan better for grant writing (and here are the strategies I use). I think the significant ongoing time investment also contributes to inequities in scientific careers, I’ll come to that in another post.\n\n\nEstimating time required on grant writing is an important part of career planning. For instance you may need to think about how you’ll fit it around the rest of your life (grant writing in my experience often requires after hours work) or field work.\nOr you may be facing the end of a research contract, and thinking about trying to win the next bucket of funding. So its worth thinking whether the time investment is worth the effort, given the risk of not winning the grant, or whether the time could be better invested in other career opportunities.\nWhen I started grant writing, my best guess for how much time it would take was: “a large proportion of working hours over several months”.\nWell, for for quite a few years years I’ve been logging my time on different tasks. My log now includes writing five applications for funding from the Australian Research Council.\nFor context, ARC grants have an overall success rate of about 20%, and a slightly lower rate for fellowships.\n\n\n\nI estimate that each grant typically requires 4-6 months preparation time at an average of about 10% of total work hours (0.1 FTE) over that period.\nBut that figure belies considerable variation in effort across time\nBelow you’ll see cumulative hours on five grants (one for which the outcome is still pending). Each application was written in a different year, but I’ve plotted them concurrently for comparison. My typical grant writing time of 70 hours counts only my time writing, editing or engaged in meetings about the grant. It doesn’t include tea breaks, reading time or thinking time or other people’s time. So actual time investment would be much greater than 70 hours.\n\nThe most recent grant took significantly less time than the others. This grant was a collaborative effort. It also came easily in that I had material and experience to draw on from previous years.\nYou’ll see I started thinking and working on each grant about 4 months ahead of time.\nThat is in part due to a very good internal preparation process my research institute (Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University) runs. Over several workshops we pitch our initial ideas and then get directed feedback on drafts of the applications.\nEffort kicks up at about 2.5 months out, when I usually aim to have a first draft written so it can be reviewed by colleagues.\nThen effort peaks just before the lead up to the 1 month mark. Most major grants require internal review by the University’s research office, and the deadline for that is 1 month before the final.\nThen in the final month effort drops off again. Usually by that point I’m just tying up lose ends and making minor corrections from the review feedback.\nI have replotted that data as fraction of my monthly work hours (not accounting for holidays).\n\nYou clearly see the peak between 3 and 2 months out.\nTo sum up, it takes time and planning to write a major grant. In follow up posts I’ll discuss the strategies I use.\nI also want to acknowledge that I have had the privileges and opportunities that help me spend time on grant writing. But not everyone has that opportunity or privilege. In a final post I’ll discuss how complex grant applications can be inequitable."

    "text": "I estimate that each grant typically requires 4-6 months preparation time at an average of about 10% of total work hours (0.1 FTE) over that period.\nBut that figure belies considerable variation in effort across time\nBelow you’ll see cumulative hours on five grants (one for which the outcome is still pending). Each application was written in a different year, but I’ve plotted them concurrently for comparison. My typical grant writing time of 70 hours counts only my time writing, editing or engaged in meetings about the grant. It doesn’t include tea breaks, reading time or thinking time or other people’s time. So actual time investment would be much greater than 70 hours.\n\nThe most recent grant took significantly less time than the others. This grant was a collaborative effort. It also came easily in that I had material and experience to draw on from previous years.\nYou’ll see I started thinking and working on each grant about 4 months ahead of time.\nThat is in part due to a very good internal preparation process my research institute (Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University) runs. Over several workshops we pitch our initial ideas and then get directed feedback on drafts of the applications.\nEffort kicks up at about 2.5 months out, when I usually aim to have a first draft written so it can be reviewed by colleagues.\nThen effort peaks just before the lead up to the 1 month mark. Most major grants require internal review by the University’s research office, and the deadline for that is 1 month before the final.\nThen in the final month effort drops off again. Usually by that point I’m just tying up lose ends and making minor corrections from the review feedback.\nI have replotted that data as fraction of my monthly work hours (not accounting for holidays).\n\nYou clearly see the peak between 3 and 2 months out.\nTo sum up, it takes time and planning to write a major grant. In follow up posts I’ll discuss the strategies I use.\nI also want to acknowledge that I have had the privileges and opportunities that help me spend time on grant writing. But not everyone has that opportunity or privilege. In a final post I’ll discuss how complex grant applications can be inequitable."

    "title": "What does under or over-dispersion look like?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One issue that often comes up in analysis with linear models is under or over dispersion.\nFor instance, if you are fitting a linear regression model, you are assuming the residuals (difference between the line of best fit and the data-points) are normally distributed. Residuals are said to be overdispersed if they are ‘fatter’ in the tails than a normal bell curve. Whereas, if the residuals are too peaked in the middle, they are said to be under-dispersed.\nUnder or over dispersion is an issue because it can bias the calculation of p-values. Over-dispersion is often of particular concern because it may cause p-values that are biased too low. If you are taking 0.05 as significant, over-dispersion will mean you would reject the null hypothesis more than 5% of the time. Thus, you may be more likely to falsely reject the null hypothesis.\nIf there is under-dispersion the opposite is true, your p-values may be too high. P-values that are biased high can be a problem, because they will give you low power to detect real effects.\nSo, let’s take a look at under and overdispersion. First, up here is a normal bell curve:\nx &lt;- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)\np &lt;- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)\nplot(x, p, type = 'l', lwd = 2, col = \"red\",\n    xlab = \"Residual\", ylab = \"Density\")\n\nNow, we can add an over-dispersed curve to that. Here is one, calculated using the Student t distribution:\np_t &lt;- dt(x, df = 1.4, ncp = 0)\n\nplot(x, p, type = 'l', lwd = 2, col = \"red\",\n    xlab = \"Residual\", ylab = \"Density\")\nlines(x, p_t, col = \"darkblue\", lwd = 2)\n\nIt wouldn’t matter how large we made the standard devation of the normal curve, we would never get it to match the Student-t.\nFinally, let’s draw an under-dispersed distribution, using the Laplace distribution\nlibrary(rmutil)\np_l &lt;- dlaplace(x, m = 0, s = 0.4)\nNow plot them all together:\nplot(x, p_l, xlim = c(-4, 4), lwd = 2, xlab = \"Residuals\", main = \"\", type = \"l\")\nlines(x, p, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\nlines(x, p_t, col = \"darkblue\", lwd = 2)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"normal\", \"under-dispersed\", \"over-dispersed\"),\n      lty = c(2,1,1), col = c(\"red\", \"black\", \"darkblue\"), lwd = 2)\n\nHere’s what they look like if we sample measures from each distribution and plot them on a normal QQ plot, which you may be familiar with. It is one of the standard checks of model residuals:\nset.seed(1997)\npar(mfrow = c(1,3))\nqqnorm(rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1), main = \"normal\")\nabline(0,1)\nqqnorm(rt(1000, df = 1.4, ncp = 0), main = \"over-dispersed\")\nabline(0,1)\nqqnorm(rlaplace(1000, m = 0, s = 0.4), main = \"under-dispersed\")\nabline(0,1)\n\nPlaying around with the parameters for each distribution should help your understanding. For instnace, if you set the scale for the Laplace distribution to a larger number it will become over-dispersed, because it gets fatter tails than the normal (despite being more peaked at its mode).\nUnder-dispersion is more common than you might think. It can occur when you have a censoring process. For instance, perhaps you machine can only measure length’s to a certain precision and any distance that is to small gets rounded down to zero."

    "title": "The next advance in spatial R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What will be the next big advance in spatial analysis using R?\n\n\nThe programming tools available for scientists to use for data analysis are becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated. This trend will continue, however I believe the most significant new advances will come from the development open, light and accessible packages. By ‘light’ I mean packages that are both easy to learn, straightforward to work with, and can run on standard desktops and laptops.\n\n\nThe capacity for languages like R to produce incredibly sophisticated analyses outstrips most people’s ability to use those tools. A few people are pushing the boundaries (e.g. see Sean Anderson and colleague’s recent global extinction risk analysis), but most scientists who use will continue to use only those tools they are most familiar with (but are pushing the boundaries of human knowledge in other ways of course).\n\n\nCase in point: the success of Wickham’s dplyr package for data wrangling in R. dplyr doesn’t really do anything you can’t do with R’s base package, but it does make data wrangling easier, more intuitive and faster. dplyr is brilliant not only because it is accessible for relative begginners, but also because it saves coding time for advanced users too.\n\n\nMore generally, other areas of science can benefit from accessible and light packages too. An example, from coral reef science. For many decades, reef scientists have been interested in how the complexity of reefs varies across environmental gradients. One way to measure complexity it to take a lead rope of say, 3 metres length, and lay it out over the contours of the reef. Then measure the rope’s resulting length when viewed from above. The ratio of lengths is then a measure of the reef’s complexity. More detailed measurements of reef complexity can be made by taking video footage and post-processing it to make 3D models of the reef. In fact, you can make precise measurements of reefs  using this method. But the fact is, people keep going back to the old lead rope method.\n\n\nThe reason people continue to use the lead rope method is that ropes are reliable and calcuting complexity from your field data is easy. Compare that with the hassles of taking a 3D camera underwater, generating large amounts of video data and then having to use complex post-processing programs to get your results. The rise of cheap high-def cameras, like go-pros has solved the first issue, but the proccessing step still remains a major challenge. Several groups have developed programs for processing 3D video over the years, but they typically required computer scientists to implement these programs. The method won’t be broadly used until someone develops a program that is accessible to reef scientists, light and cheap.\n\n\nThe uptake of R’s sophisticated spatial tools also faces the same challenge: many of them are accessible only to experienced programmers. This is changing of course, for instance the raster package comes with very accessible help files. The developers are even expanding it to include some processing options for shape files. However, the documentation for the main package for processing shapes, rgeos, is quite technical. Further, rgeos operations often through up incomprehensible errors when you perform common tasks like polygon intersects.\n\n\nThe potential to use R as a fully functioning GIS is only just beginning to be realised. So watch this space."

    "text": "First, what’s a ‘conservation priority?’\nIn a response letter we argued that effective conservation requires clear objectives and prioritizing actions, not places or species. Lots of studies have used the term ‘priority’ loosely, e.g. you see studies talking about priority areas, species or threats. But the problem with this language is it doesn’t say what we need to do. Priorities should be about actions, then they are clear. Many have previously showed that if you follow actions guided by ‘priority threats’ or ‘priority areas’ you can end up with costly and ineffective conservation outcomes.\nFor example, consider a case where the priority species is one doomed for extinction, or an enigmatic one that isn’t that threatened, we’d be wasting money trying to conserve it. Same goes, if we prioritize ‘threat hotspots’ then we may spend big on local conservation when unmanageable threats, like climate change are a big issue.\nPriorities should consider what the objectives are, what the actions are, and constraints on those actions. This is important to find those places where conservation can be most effective.\nI’d define effective as outcomes that the best you can get relative to what would have happened if you didn’t do that action.\nLots of global priority maps are actually maps of hotspots of species richness etc… Nothing wrong with that, we just shouldn’t claim they are conservation priorities."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Good storytelling is essential to write a successful research paper. And I don’t mean making things up. Science stories need to rely on data. But we need to write up the data as a story so people get it.\nKey to good writing is building a coherent story.\nIt is important to emphasis that your research paper doesn’t have to be comprehensive - you can’t address every caveat or cite every relevant piece of work - but it must be coherent.\nBut what is a ‘coherent’ story?\nOne conceptual model (I love models!) for thinking about what a coherent story is to think about a web of cause and effect.\nYour paper should build a web, or in the simplest case a chain, of cause-effect actions. If everything in your paper is related by cause and effect, then it will be coherent.\nA model of a coherent research story as a cause-effect web.\nThere are a few more rules to consider, but it will be easiest if we bring up an example.\nConsider Dale Bryan-Brown’s recent review of studies of population connectivity in marine ecosystems.\nHe opened the study with an observation that there are many studies of population connectivity in marine systems. That is the effect. Then he moves on to explain they have never been synthesised - a new ‘cause’. He then builds an argument around why a synthesis is needed to fill this knowledge gap (an effect again). And so the paper goes.\nNow, we want to make sure we don’t have any extraneous causes or effects or cause-effect pairs floating around in the text. Such loose cause-effect pairs will contribute to building an incoherent story.\nAn example of this would be a recent paper we published about a new statistical method, which we applied to study the effects of pollution on coral reefs. In the Discussion we bring up important caveats to the new method and discuss ways future studies could improve on what we did.\nWe don’t spend time discussing uncertainty around the physiology for how pollution kills corals, because the main ‘story’ is about the application of the statistical method. Discussion of physiology would be extraneous and therefore incoherent.\nThe Discussion and Conclusion of the paper should tie up most of the cause-effect pairs, ending on effects (i.e. the observation and implications of your study). However, you may want to specify some future research directions too. These are ‘causes’ that you want future studies to go out and answer.\nSo I hope you find this conceptual model useful. Let me know what you think on Twitter."

    "text": "The Observation Challenge\nThe first challenge was accessing sufficient observations of run-off and coastal ecosystems so that we would be able to understand where the runoff is coming from, where it goes in the ocean and what impacts it has to ecosystems and fisheries. Obtaining suffcient data is challenge in tropical catchments in particular, because they are typically poorly studied.\nWe had to overcome this challenge in all the areas that we worked in.\nOne way that we did so was to make the most of freely available global datasets, such as those measured by satellites. We also tried to make the most of data that were already available in our study regions.\nFor instance, in Fiji we used satellite images of forest cover and water clarity to make predictions about where sediment runoff from deforestation is coming from and where in the ocean it is going.\nIn Papua New Guinea we used globally available maps of soil cover and maps of elevation to build predictive models of nutrient and sediment run-off.\nLead author Viv Tulloch, could then predict how much nutrients and sediment would may reach coastal ecosystems under different scenarios for the conversion of primary forest to oil palm plantations. We where then able to recommend modified sustainability guidelines for oil palm plantations, which would minimise their impacts on coastal ecosystems.\nIn Fiji we used extensive surveys of reef fish abundance, that had previously been collected by the Wildlife Conservation Society, and related them back to water clarity. The differences in reef fish abundance from low to high water clarity gave us an idea for how sedimentation may affect reef fish abundance.\nImportantly, large predators may be some of the most affected by poor water clarity, and these species are also locally important for fisheries."

    "title": "Identifying conservation priorities for ridge to reef management in tropical catchments",
    "section": "The Tracing Challenge",
    "text": "The Tracing Challenge\nA major challenge for Ridge to Reef management is that we often to don’t know where the pollutants come from or if there are multiple sources, which ones are the worest offenders. This is a crucial step if we want to then identify where forest protections should be placed.\nIn Fiji we faced this challenge because there are so many rivers that empty near to coral reefs. So it is not immediately clear which catchments were the cause of poor water clarity.\nWe developed a new type of modelling technique that enabled us to make educated guesses about which Rivers where likely having the greatest contribution to poor water clarity on coral reefs. This meant we could then trace pollution back to those catchments that were the worst offenders and identify places where protection a forest might be a priority for conserving coral coral reefs and their fisheries.\nImportantly this modelling technique worked with freely available satellite data, so it can be straightforward to apply in data poor regions.\nFor our work in the Kia region of the Solomon Islands with The Nature Conservancy we could not get accurate measurements of water clarity with satellites, because the islands were two topographic complex and the water too shallow.\nHowever, the Nature Conservancy had extensive surveys of lagoonal coral reefs in the region of Kia.\nIn Kia logging operators create ‘log ponds’. Log ponds are spots on the coast where they bulldoze mangroves so that they can drag logs off the land onto transport ships.\nLog ponds are major sources of sediment to lagoonal coral reefs.\nThere was concern that the sediment was smothering branching corals that are important habitat for the bumphead parrotfish, itself an important fishery species. Bumphead parrotfish are also listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as a threatened species.\nWe wanted to estimate the area of the reef habitats that were affected by the log ponds.\nTo do so we used the reef surveys, which covered many different types of corals and also other types of benthos, that included branching corals, brain corals that are very stressed tolerant, algae, silt and sand.\nWe analysed how the community changed from high coverage of branching corals in clear waters far from log ponds, to higher coverage of stress tolerant corals, silt and sand in murky waters near to log ponds. We could then use the coral reef benthos types as indicators for how far the impact of sedimentation reached from log ponds.\nUsing these predictions we can then predict how much of all the coral reefs in the region have been affected by logging.\nThis was useful because it told us about 60% of the region had already been affected by logging. This includes the loss of branching corals that are important habitat for bumphead parrotfish\nFurthermore we could evaluate what area of lagoonal coral reefs had been protected by recent actions to stop further illegal logging in the Kia region.\nSo so the data on coral reefs helped us to resolve the tracing challenge of where pollutant impacts are sourced from. This work could be used to inform on priorities for where future should not be located."

The response of fishers themselves to changes in abundance can mitigate or amplify the impacts of pollution on fisheries.\nAnother important challenge is improving the accessibility of models and the data that are required to build those models. This will mean they can be easily applied data poor tropical catchments by small research teams who are often working under tight stable time and budget constraints.\nAnother team has been developing global models of sediment runoff, which may help fill this knowledge gap and make reliable models more accessible.\nAs for our working group it is finished now, but we are still in the process of publishing the last few papers. Look out for our next one in a few months that looks at the range of models available for informing ridge to reef management or get in touch if you would like to read a pre-print."

We’re facing a global environmental crisis. Emissions are accelerating again, the climate is rapidly warming, we’re losing the world’s biodiversity, people have nothing to eat because the environment is too degraded.\nWe need good committed scientists who stay the course for careers in all areas of environmental science.\nPeer-reviews are often at odds with that goal. Many reviews are written to put people down, rather than build them up.\nI was recently forwarded reviews on a paper a student is leading. The paper was rejected, which is fine. Its a normal part of the publication process and the production of valid science.\nHowever, I felt so frustrated about one of these reviws. It was so mean and nit-picked every last detail in the paper.\nThat’s not helping us to create the next generation of committed scientists. Its slowing them down, and probably pushing some away.\nThe people writing these reviews don’t know how privileged they are.\nIf you go talk to people working with conservation on the ground you will realize this.\nConservationists are facing urgent issues, with communicating the importance of ecosystems to government and the public. Urgent issues that need some science advice now, not perfect science in 10 years.\nSo sitting around pulling apart every last detail in a paper you’ve been sent to review is a privilege.\nWhat should you do?\nAsk yourself: is this science good enough? By good enough I mean are the conclusions scientific?\nThe study might not be done the way you would do it, frame the introduction how you think it should be done, or cite the references you would want to cite. But you need to weigh the effort required to make those changes against what the world needs us to be spending our time on.\nIf you nit-pick every last detail then the you’re burning the time of the scientists that now have to respond on all those details.\nThat’s time they could be spending on working with policy-makers on solutions, educating the public, or training new scientists.\nActivities that actually help the issues the world faces.\nIf its a student who gets this review you’re doing an even greater disservice. Not only are you wasting time, but you might be killing their confidence. That’s going to slow them down 10 times over.\nSo yes we should peer-review. Yes we should absolutely reject papers if the science isn’t valid. But don’t go overboard on your reviews. If you’re going to reject a paper, just bring up the main 1 or 2 flaws.\nThat’s enough to reject it if it needs rejecting.\nAnd be nice.\nPS\nIf you want to go one better, you can offer encouragement. Even if you ultimately recommend rejecting the paper. Here’s how\nPPS If the quality of the science in a paper makes you really mad then you should try even harder to write an encouraging review.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A deep dive into stock assessments of fisheries around the world has revealed their sustainability is overstated – and it has implications for fisheries management and consumer awareness.\nStock assessments are conducted regularly to measure the impact of fishing on fish and shellfish populations in global fisheries management regions. These assessments inform approaches for preventing overfishing, rebuilding overfished stocks and protecting marine ecosystems.\nIn a new study published in the journal Science, an international research team compared past and recent stock assessments across 230 fisheries worldwide.\n“Independent scientific monitoring is essential for accurately assessing fish stock sustainability,” said IMAS marine ecologist and lead author of the study, Professor Graham Edgar.\n“This study was an opportunity to compare the stock status estimated in a given year, such as 2010, with a more recent revised estimate for that same year – and we found that the earlier stock assessments were often too optimistic about the number of fish in the ocean.”\nThe study showed an inconsistency in stock assessments, with a strong pattern of over-estimating a fishery’s population status for stocks that were most depleted.\n“Depleted fish stocks are often the most contentious,” Professor Edgar said. “When a stock is overfished, fisheries management needs to make tough decisions about reducing fish catches to reverse the trend in stock declines. This includes reducing catch limits, which will ensure the fish stock can continue to support food and jobs into the future.”\nIMAS researcher and co-author, Dr Nils Krueck, said stock assessment scientists around the world acknowledge the issues highlighted in the study.\n“I believe it’s vital to bring these issues into focus, as it will lead to improvements in the way we do our assessments and ultimately improve fisheries management globally.”\nIMAS marine ecologist and study co-author, Associate Professor Chris Brown, said the rising trends in the biomass of overfished stocks noted in some stock assessments often disappeared in later assessments, suggesting they were too optimistic about the pace of recovery in overfished stocks.\n“When management put limits on catches, many overfished populations have failed to recover as quickly as expected, so our study suggests the assessments tools being used are too optimistic about the real recovery potential,” he said.\nThe study also found that fish stocks with low economic value, or in areas with rapidly rising sea temperatures, were more susceptible to inaccurate assessments.\n“Stocks with low economic value will usually have less scientific information to inform the assessments – and this may impact the ability to accurately assess stock status,” Associate Professor Chris Brown said.\n“Meanwhile, fish stocks in ocean warming hotspots are often under-estimated, as stock assessments are not well tuned to populations extending their range into cooler regions – which is happening much faster than expected.”\nThe study highlights ways to improve the accuracy of fish stock assessments, such as expanding independent fisheries monitoring and changing stock assessment protocols.\n“This could include establishing a ‘red team’ that looks at potential worst case scenarios and works to prevent the collapse of fish biomass,” Professor Edgar said.\n“Our study clearly shows we need to take a much greater precautionary approach to protect our vital fish stocks around the world – for sustainable fisheries and healthy oceans, and ultimately for our own food security.”\nCitation: Graham J.

    "title": "How to work with non-governmental organisations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I attended a symposium for scientists and non-governmental organisations at the Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science at the University of Queensland recently.\nThe aim of the symposium was to promote more collaboration between NGOs and conservation scientists. Here are some of the key lessons I took home.\nOne researcher told me she wish she’d had such a symposium when she started her PhD. It would have given her the know-how needed to reach out to NGOs and start collaborating as part of her PhD.\nSo here are the key lessons.\n\nLook up NGOs in your area and read about their science priorities. Many, like Birdlife Australia (who presented at there) publish their science priorities.\nGet in touch with NGO staff. If you know someone who knows someone at an NGO that is great. Start by asking your supervisor. If not, try just emailing the contact on the NGOs webpage and say you are a scientist looking to align your research for more impact.\nAsk what their science needs are. If you can get a meeting with the NGO staff, great. But don’t waste your meeting pitching your ideas to them. Listen first. Find out what their problems and issues are. They probably have science needs outlined already. For instance, the presenter from The Wilderness Society pitched several ideas they’d love to have science on for their advocacy work. These included analyses of national threats to Australian fauna and attribution of extinction risk to specific industries.\nAlign your science with their priorities. The next step would be to come up with a research plan. Make sure it aligns with their priorities. If you can get time with the NGO, pitch the plan back to them (its ok to pitch now that you’ve listened to what their needs are). If you can’t, you may still like to go ahead and do the research in the hope they pick it up later. For instance, Birdlife Aus has aligned their science awards to their priorities.\nBe mindful of timelines. NGO timelines are often fast moving. Their priorities can shift rapidly as funding or politics change. This can be a challenge for research projects.\n\nFor PhD students I wouldn’t recommend projects that have strict deliverables to a deadline. For instance, they may need to deliver results in a timely manner to be able to influence major new government policies. Or they may be looking to contract someone to prepare a report. PhDs need time to learn and this often takes longer than NGO timelines.\nThat being said, NGOs often have many research ideas they’d like to do, but which their work isn’t directly dependent on. These kinds of projects can be great for students. Just be mindful that if the research drags on too long (like years) the NGO may shift their priorities and you’ll lose engagement.\nSo aim for projects that need 6 months to a year to complete. Talk to your supervisor about projecting time needed, as we all tend to underestimate that.\n\nNGOs are often under-resourced. Which means they probably won’t have bucket loads of funding for your project, but they do love help where they can get it. If you are a PhD student with time and capacity to share, then they’ll probably love that. So don’t be shy about reaching out.\n\nJust be sure to plan your engagement with NGOs with a mentor or supervisor. You want to make sure you align the project with your skillset and feasible timelines for providing results.\nWorking with NGOs has been one of the most rewarding parts of my career. As an academic (and as a student) I have the luxury of getting to spend some of my time on passion projects. Sometimes the ‘work for free’ has then lead onto funded work.\nThe research I’ve done with NGOs has often lead to real world impact.

    "section": "Consider identifiability",
    "text": "Consider identifiability\nIdentifiability is a common issue in SEM. Roughly it means that some of the free parameters you are trying to estimate are interchangeable. Therefore, even with an infinite amount of data you would be unable to identify their values precisely (e.g. one could be high the other low or vice-versa).\nA basic example would be the model:\ny = a*x + b*x + c\nparameters a and b are interchangeable.\nIdentifiability is a bit different in Bayesian models, because we have priors. For instance, in the model above, if we set a very strong priors on a and/or b (based on theory for instance) we may still be able to estimate their values precisely.\nIn a complex SEM issues of identifiability can be much harder to distinguish than the example above, as we will see.\nIdentifiability issues in a Bayesian will manifest as poor convergence of MCMC chains. You will see high Rhats. Digger deeper you may find some parameters have bimodal posterior distributions (e.g. if you do a histogram of all samples for a parameter). You will also find strong correlations in parameter estimates. For instance in the model above parameters a and b would be strongly correlated (near 1).\nYou may be able to get convergence if you run your model for really long chains, however, it will be more efficient to try and fix the model. It will also mean your parameters are easier to interpret.\nIf you have identifiability issues, parameters that have the property above are a good place to start to try to fix issues in your SEM formulation.\nIn the stsan code above I’ve made two key decisions to facilitate convergence.\nFirst, I’ve fixed the latent standard deviation to 1 to ensure identifiability. You could also have the latent’s SD free, but then fix one of the regression slopes to 1.\nSecond, I’ve set the prior for the streamflow beta (regression slope on the latent variable) to be an exponential. This ensures it has only positive values.\nFor example, imagine that streamflow, NDVI and CPUE are all positively correlated with each other. Then their beta’s all need to be the same sign. However, they could equally well be all positive, or all negative. The meaning is the same, since the latent variable has not units.\nIf we run the model where all betas are sampled from normal priors, then we would hit issues with parameter switching. We see strong bimodality in the posteriors for the betas, because they can equally well be all positive or all negative. This slows converngence significantly.\nSo instead I’ve used an exponential(1.8) prior for the streamflow beta. This peg the sign to whatever streamflow is doing. So if streamflow is positive and the other covariates are positively associated with it, they will all have positive betas.\nI chose 1.8 so that my prior has similar 90th percentile as a normal distribution. e.g. compare qnorm(0.9, 0,1) to qexp(0.9, 1.8) both have 90th percentiles at about 1.28."

This means checking distributions are appropriate to model the data, same as you would for any GLM.\nIn a SEM we also have to think about d-separation. In short, this means checking for residual correlations between a our variables that aren’t explicitly part of the model.\nThere’s formal tests of d-separation for Bayesian models, but many authors have just used visual checks of residual correlations.\nThere are many resources on d-separation, here’s one paper. Books by Judea Pearl and Bill Shipley are also good ways to learn.\nOur data here also has the additional complexity of being time-series. Our model above assumes d-separation of a variable from itself through time, so this is also something we could check (by testing for autocorrelation in the residuals).\nI won’t show all these tests in this brief tute, but here’s a start on getting residuals. Just subtract the predictions from the observations, e.g. for NDVI:\nmed &lt;- apply(samps$NDVI_pred, 2, median)\nresids &lt;- datstan$NDVI - med\nOne way to check the normal distribution is appropriate for the NDVI data is to do a quantile-quantile plot of the residuals:\nqqnorm(resids)\nqqline(resids)\n\nWe want to see the points fall close to straight on the line, which in general they do.\nWe can also check for non-linearities by plotting observations vs predictions:\nplot(med, datstan$NDVI)\n\nOf course this is Bayesian analysis, so we could also create credible intervals for the residuals.\nIf you do the above for CPUE you’ll see there is clearly strong autocorrelation.

But if you have a background in one or the other, and some programming ability, then it won’t be too hard.\nI learned Bayesian modelling well before I started on SEMs. When I came to SEM (through the lavaan package) I was overwhelmed and confused by jargon and interpretation of greek letters that have a special meaning to SEM specialists. I found it much easier to gain a high level understanding of SEM issues (like d-seperation) then work in the Bayesian framework to build models."

    "text": "News\nI’ve just back from a holiday in and around Noosa, where I had lots of time to spend paddling, thinking and being around Noosa’s beautiful estuaries and lakes. Time away from work is really important for giving yourself space to think about big picture questions, like where is biodiversity science going in the next few years?\nWell its been a year of big changes, and Australia is facing probably its third existential crisis this year, with announcement of massive increase in military funding to address ‘regional instability’ and geopolitical disruption in the Asia-Pacific.\nAs a team we’re going to change tack and spend more time tackling risk-based research, in particular, the modelling, prediction and management of risks to marine biodiversity conservation. This theme fits naturally with the way our research is going, but we will now bring it further to the forefront of what we do, as society increasingly appreciates the massive impact of extreme events on economies and the environments.\nWe have a grant starting on the topic of environmental risk assessment, to be announced formally soon. The notion of dealing with enviro risk runs through a number of our current projects as well. I’m leading writing of a review on planning for risk in a spatial context. Renee Piccolo started her PhD earlier this year, and is addressing how we plan for feasibility in conservation and restoration of coastal habitats. Alyssa Giffin, is close to wrapping up her thesis chapter on prioritizing conservation actions to enhance ‘ecosystem based adaptation’ to extreme climate events.\nWe’ve been running a major research program on multiple stressors to marine ecosystems, which has been keeping Olivia King, Laura Griffiths, Mischa Turschwell and our collaborators busy. A central theme to that work is that we can’t hope to measure all the unexpected impacts of the multitude of interacting stressors that affect coastal ecosystems, so we need model that can predict them, or we need management actions that are robust to uncertainty. So the next phase of that research is looking at the role of extreme events in driving risks to coastal systems.\nAnother new research direction for the team will be looking at how we analyse the new large-datasets being produced by automated classification of images, particularly the work Rod Connolly’s lab is doing on enviro monitoring using AI tools to classify fish species in videos. This new data poses new opportunities and issues for eco-statistics.\nWe’ll be starting a new honours student next week, one of the top undergraduates from my modelling class, Jordan Holdorf. Jordan has a maths undergrad and will be looking at how we can make the most of AI generated data in statistical analyses, both dealing with its shortcomings, but also making the most of its strengths.\nWe’ll also be continuing our work with The Nature Conservancy on electronic monitoring of longline tuna vessels in the western Pacific. Improving monitoring of tuna fisheries in the region is important for economic stability of western Pacific countries and for conserving pelagic ecosystems. There are also opportunities to apply AI tools in this work. I hope to recruit a PhD student to work on this topic soon."

    "text": "Career goals\nWith all the paddling I also had time to think about career long goals for myself, and the seascapemodels research team.\nIn reflecting on these questions for myself I realized that planning career goals is not something we talk about much, or get a lot of mentoring on. Yes, we do lots of planning and discussion about goals for 1,2,3 year time horizons. But what about career accomplishments? In some sense there is an expectation in academia that you carry the aspirations of your own mentors or institution, such as grant funding, senior positions or publication. Everyone needs to work with these systems to some extent, in order to achieve what they want. But it’s in authoring our own goals that I think we really find job satisfaction.\nSo I had two realisations in Noosa that I would like to shift my priorities for how I spend my own time. First, is to actually put a bit more time into the things that are important to my own long-term career goals. That is (1) investing a little bit of time in my passion project on information theory in ecology and (2) starting my conservation hacking platform to expand the work we do on training scientists and conservationists in R, GIS, statistics and data wrangling. More on that soo.\nAs homework I’ve asked the lab to think about their own career/lifetime objectives. One way to start thinking about this is to ask yourself “why did I choose a career in science over other careers?” To get to the root of why, you should ask yourself this question three times. For instance “Why did I choose a career in science?” “To help the environment” “What makes me want to help the environment so much?” “I think we need to do more to avoid loosing so many species so fast” “Where does your passion for helping the environment come from?” And so on Understanding not just WHAT you are working towards, but also WHERE your goals come from is important. The where is important because it tells us how much our goals are our own, versus somebody else’s goals. Often we find to some extent we are working towards goals someone else gave us, that might be ok, but it might also be a source of dissatisfaction if those goals don’t fit our true passion.\nWhen you feel you can write down pretty clearly what your goals are, and importantly, where they’ve come from, then move onto this next step. Consider 1 or more of the below. 1. What activities can I start doing this week that will help me further my goals? 2. What things am I currently doing that hinder, or detract time away from, my goals? 3. Who can I inspire, recruit, delegate to help me achieve my goals?\nWe’ll discuss those last three things in the next lab meeting."

The development of prompts, data extraction and data cleaning is time consuming and requires thought. So it will still take work to do a systematic review. I’d also recommend you manually check results so that you still learn something yourself and to correct errors.\nI’ll also mention that papers are coming out now testing this idea, e.g. this one shows the AI’s results can be accurate, but only for some types of requests. The supplemental code for that paper also has helpful guidance.\nWe’ll need a few R skills to extract data from papers for lit reviews:\nI’ll mainly focus on step 1 here. Step 2 is possible, by can be finniky and depend on how the pdf is formated. Step 3 is pretty straightforward with a package like stringr. Step 4 is just looping with whatever framework you prefer for that (e.g. for loops or purrr).\nThis blog deals with only one type of application of LLMs to lit reviews, that is maybe the most straightforward and cheapest.

People use these to make the AI act like a certain character, such as a research assistant. Let’s see it in action.\nPrompting is like programming, but less precise (annoyingly for me, who likes programming and things to be exact!). Good prompts will tend to get you better results.

    "text": "Reflections on challenges and next steps for automating data extraction\n\nCost uncertainty\nThis should be cheap. It cost &lt;1c to make this post with all the testing. So in theory you could do 100s of methods sections for &lt;100USD. However, if you are testing back and forwards a lot or using full papers the cost could add up. It will be hard to estimate this until people get more experience.\n\n\nObtaining the papers and dealing with unstructued text in PDFs or HTML\nA big challenge will be getting the text into a format that the LLM can use. Then there are issues like obtaining the text. Downloading pdfs is time consuming and data intensive. Trying to read text data from webpages can also be hard, due to paywalls and rate limits (you might get blocked for making reqeat requests).\nFor instance, in a past study we did where we did simple ‘bag of words analysis’ we either downloaded the pdfs manually, or set timers to delay web hits and avoid getting blocked.\nHTML format would be ideal, because the tags mean the sections of the paper, and the figures already semi-structured.\n\n\nPrompting\nNeed to experiment with this to get it right. It might also be good to repeat prompt the same text to triangulate accurate results.\n\n\nLLM text output cleaning\nIn my simple example this was easy. However, with a large number of prompts and papers the LLM responses might have more variability that needs to be dealt with, e.g. will it always use one line break between my data questions? You can help control this issue by asking it to structure output in xml or JSON format, which is easier to then parse into data sheets.\n\n\nThe data still isn’t data and requires interpretation\nYou can see from my simple examples above that the output can’t be plotted direclty. In fact, it requires more interpretation. The sample size was given as ‘357 sets (electronic monitoring) for large-scale longline fishery (LLF)’. So is it 357? Are there other sample sizes that might be relevant?\n\n\nValidation\nYou’ll definitely want to manually check the output and report accuracy statistics in your study. So maybe your review has 1000 papers, you’ll want to manually check 100 of them to see how accurate the LLM was.\n\n\nYou’ll still need to read a lot of papers to write a good lit review\nA lit review is more than the systematic data. I still believe you need to read a lot of papers in order to understand the literature and make a useful synthesis. If you just use AI you’re vulnerable to the ‘illusion of understanding’.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis tool will be best for well defined tasks and consistently written papers. For instance, an ideal use case would be reviewing 500 ocean acidification papers that all used similar experimental designs and terminology. You’ll then be able to get consistent answers to prompts about sample size etc…\nAnother good use case would be to extract model types from species distribution model papers.\nHarder tasks will be where the papers are from diverse disciplines, or use inconsistent terminology, or methods. My study was a good example of that, there were about 5 different sample sizes reported. So in this example we’d need first to think clearly about what sample size you wanted to extract before writing the prompt."

So here I wanted to cover a brief user guide for posting pre-prints.\nThe guide is based on the opportunities and problems I have come across during my (very short) pre-print posting career.\nBut first, let’s look at the pros and cons of even posting one in the first place."

    "title": "Guide to posting pre-prints for ecologists",
    "section": "Pros and cons",
    "text": "Pros and cons\nThe broader benefits and costs have been well covered in the blogosphere, but a few key points are listed here. A good guide to pros and cons was written up in sciencemag. The blog Small Pond Science also has a very reasoned article about why its author doesn’t post pre-prints.\nPros\n\nOther scientists can use (and cite) your article sooner.\nThe pre-print will be open-access, even if your peer-reviewed version is pay-walled.\nGain exposure for your work without waiting for review, which can be particularly important for early career scientists.\nYou can share articles with the science community that you perhaps never intend to publish in a peer-reviewed journal, like this guide to structuring papers. They will also have a DOI so you can get credit for citations.\nYou claim priority for a piece of work that someone else may be about to publish.\nThere is the opportunity to gain pre-review comments that may help improve your article.\n\nCons\nI think most of the cons can actually be avoided or mitigated. The first oft cited one is that someone might ‘steal’ your ideas and scoop your work. Though in reality I think this is a very rare occurrence. Might be worth considering though if you are working on very hot topic.\nThe second is that some journals don’t support pre-prints, though I haven’t encountered any. Even Science and Nature support pre-prints.\nThe next few issues are important, but are discussed more rarely in the broader blogosphere.\nThe third problem is that some journals don’t support you talking to the press about pre-prints. For instance Science Magazine may take any pre-publication press into account when making a decision on your article. Easy to avoid this problem, just don’t do a press release on your article, the press are unlikely to hear about it on their own.\nA fourth problem is that pre-prints can reveal the identity of a paper’s authors, which may break double-blind peer review. A reviewer apparently googled one of my paper titles that was under double blind peer review and find the pre-print (a dubious practice perhaps?). Then they wrote in their review - Chris you should never post pre-prints before submitting the article.\nBut what’s the point of a pre-print if it isn’t posted pre-review? I think its the authors’ prerogative to decide whether they might waive anonymity for the sake of a pre-print (an issue I did consider before submitting said paper). Either way, I think it is a potential issue you should consider, particularly if you want double-blind review.\nI look forwards to starting a debate between the double-blind proponents and the pre-print proponents on Twitter one day so, but will leave that for another blog.\nThe final and I think most problematic issue that I see is that there will be multiple versions of your paper online once it is published. This blog has a more detailed discussion of how that is potentially an issue. If your paper changes considerably in peer-review, then these different versions may also have very different content. The multiple version problem is something that is worth considering carefully.\nOne more note, bioRXiv is sponsored by the Chan Zuckerberg (ie Facebook’s CEO and his surgeon wife) initiative. You might want to consider what they want to do with all these pre-prints. Purportedly they are just interested in speeding up science to help with breakthroughs in medicine…\nSee my guide below for how you can mitigate the final issue.\nOverall I think the pros just outweigh the cons. I started posting pre-prints because I was using other people’s to inform my science, so it made sense to post my own. Having said that I don’t post every article as a pre-print and largely let my students decide whether they want to do it or not.\nIf you follow my guide below it will help you avoid some of the cons and maximise some of the pros."

    "text": "Guide to submitting and revising pre-prints\nI am going to assume you are working on submitting something to bioRXiv.\n1. Finish your article and gain approval from coauthors\nYou should always check with your coauthors before posting a pre-print. You also might want to check the pre-print policy of your target journal.\nI recommend create a finished version, like what you would be happy to submit for peer-review (or better!). This article will be free and open to the world, so you will have to live with it for ever! Make sure you have coauthors, or even a colleague, check over it before submitting it to.\nDON’T SUBMIT IT TO A JOURNAL YET. Technically you need to get your bioRXiv article up before submitting to a peer-reviewed journal.\n1b. Formatting!\nThe document as you upload it will be the preprint that everyone can access. I prefer to upload PDFs so I have full control over how they look. Some points to consider:\n\nAdd footnotes with the page number, your name and perhaps the title and a statement about it being a pre-print. This ensures if the document is downloaded and distributed it is clear who wrote it and that it is pre-review.\nMake sure your email is somewhere in the document. So people can contact you easily.\nI like the put figures and tables in the text, rather than at the end (which is how some backwards journals want them submitted), just because I find it annoying to flip back and forwards in the document when reading it.\nDon’t forget to check references are correctly entered etc…\n\n2. Sign up for bioRXiv and get an ORCID\nIt all works better if you have an ORCID I’ve found. Then pre-prints will link to your other profiles.\n3. Follow the steps to upload your article\nThis is pretty similar to the standard journal submission process. Some journals even allow you to submit your pre-print directly.\n4. Choose your licence\nOne important step is that you will get to choose the license your article is distributed under. There are many choices. I use the attribution commercial and non-commercial license. This means people can re-use the article so long as they attribute the source. I allow commercial use because that includes teaching and textbooks. Put some thought into this though, this license also will mean that a book doesn’t have to pay you a fee to use the figures for instance.\n5. Submit and approve the article to bioRXiv\nThen it should appear on bioRXiv in a day or so.\n6. Tell other scientists about it\nThis is important only if you want feedback. I usually post them on Twitter and perhaps email a few people. If you are serious about getting pre-review comments, then this step is essential. It is unlikely that people will just see the article on bioRXiv.\nYou can also link the article to your Google Scholar page if you wish. This is how some colleagues have found out about my latest work (Google Scholar stalking me, but don’t laugh I know we all do it).\nMake sure you check the comments option under your bioRXiv article too, I don’t think you get alerts if someone posts to this (though it seems to be rare).\n7. Submit to a peer-reviewed journal\nYou can do this straight away after it appears on bioRXiv, or wait a few weeks to get pre-review comments.\n8. Revise your pre-print BEFORE your article is accepted at a peer-review journal\nYour can’t revise pre-prints once the article is accepted at a peer-review journal. I tried to update a title once and was blocked - it seems bioRXiv automatically searches the literature for matching titles (and can find accepted articles even before they are posted online!). If they find your article listed at a journal they will block you from revising it.\nIt is important to revise it to minimise issues with having different versions on the web. For instance, people may be confused about similar articles with slightly different titles.\nCheck the journal’s copyright policy though, some consider that they own the rights to review comments and your revisions, in which case any revision to your pre-print based on review comments may be illegal. Other publishers apparently allow posting of the accepted version as a pre-print.\n9. Optional: Do press on your article\nAs I said above, some journals don’t like press/media attention before publication. Also I think it is bad for science if we start sharing work that isn’t peer-reviewed with the general public. Peer-review, with all its flaws, is still our gold standard for making sure science is robust and credible.\n10. Check your pre-print links to the published article\nIf the title of the pre-print and the published article are identical (ie not even one word different) then the preprint should automatically link to the published article. So your work can be properly attributed (and cites won’t be split across different versions).\nIf the titles are different and they don’t pick up the published version, you can email bioRXiv the published paper once it has been out at least 2 weeks and they say they will fix it.\n11. Optional: Check links to your article on search engines\nYou might want to check if search engines, e.g. Google Scholar, pick up on the open-access pdf version of your article. If they don’t you can also try posting the post-review, pre-print version to a university repository or your webpage or ResearchGate (if the journal’s license allows you to do so, which many do)."

The pre-print has actually been cited, though it is still not published. I am a bit worried how different the pre-print and the published version may be, though I just need to make sure I submit a revision before it is accepted.\nThe third article has just been accepted and I just realised the title was changed in review. So I need to make sure it links back. Aside from that they are pretty similar.\nThe fourth article I just submitted. I am in no rush to publish it, so am going to wait a few weeks and seek pre-review comments on the article. Will update you how that goes. Hopefully the article will be stronger when it comes to submission. For instance I plan on seeking feedback from some statisticians who wouldn’t likely be approached by the journal’s editor.\n\nSummary\nThat’s the guide. Consider carefully whether pre-prints are for you, or not. Some people are rampant pre-print advocates or haters, don’t take their word for it though. The reality is that there is a mix of benefits and costs. If you take a few steps you can maximise those benefits and dodge some of the costs."

They are delegating decisions, either because they don’t know how, or they don’t have the time to make the decisions themselves.\n“Opportunities” like organising a symposium are packed full of decisions, like what food to order, who to invite….\nStruggling to find motivation to finish writing a paper or report?\nThat is because writing is packed full of decisions, like what words to use and where to put them. It is a major brain drain to make all these decisions, so we are inclined to put them off.\nFeeling stressed about the end of your PhD approaching?\nAt least part of the stress is knowing that you will have some major life changes coming up, that will require lots of decisions. Like where to live, where to work and so on.\nI am actually in the process of making a major life decision myself - we are looking to buy our first house.\nSo here are some hacks I have developed over the years that help to reduce stress and make decisions more time effective.\n\n\nYou can’t realise you’re stressed about decisions until you realise you’re stressed. You also need self-awareness to know what decisions are stressing you.\nThe best way to get self awareness is to practice mindfullness and/or mediation. Seriously. Many professional sports people consider mediation a critical part of their training.\nSo why not other types of professionals?\nAn easy way to be more mindful is to acknowledge to yourself how you are feeling. Actually say the words, “I am feeling stressed out by…” (or at least actively thinking them). Do that for a few minutes and you might learn alot about what decisions matter to you right now.\nMost large institutions will also offer a free and anonymous counciling service for staff. These are useful in my experience because the counciller will help you develop tools for being more self aware.\n\n\n\nBig decisions, like deciding where to buy or rent a house, or what job to go for are hard because they are actually composed of many small decisions.\nSo break them up into chunks. For instance, decide what suburb you want to be in first. Then what size house and so on.\n\n\n\nOften decisions are hard because the outcomes are uncertain.\nFor instance, you are not sure where to start addressing a critique on your work (like reviews on a paper) because you are not sure of the best way to make ammends with the critic.\nSo break the problem into smaller parts, address the first part and then test it. Do this iteratively until you reach an adequate solution.\nFor instance, if a reviewer didn’t like the method you used, perhaps it was because you explained it poorly. So edit the explanation and show your edits to someone else. If it works for them, you might have solved the problem. If it doesn’t work, maybe its time to try and change the method.\nSelf awareness is very helpful here too. You might not realise that the uncertainty of a decision is stressing you out until you conciously analyse your feelings on the topic.\n\n\n\nAnother obvious way to deal with uncertainty in the outcome of decisions is to do more research!\nFor instance, we want to buy a house, but don’t want to get ripped off. So we need to research what people are paying. Simple.\n\n\n\nOften other people are making the same decisions as you, often with better knowledge. Perhaps they are more experienced, or have had more time to learn about the decision.\nSo find those people and copy them.\nIn doing so though, we haven’t avoided a decision, we have just changed the question from ‘what to do?’, into ‘who to copy?’\nSo we may turned our decision about what statistical method to use on our data into a decision about determining who is an expert in analysing that type of data.\nThis type of decision is often much easier to solve. For instance, you can easily ask around or just look at what the experts in your field are doing.\n\n\n\nOften in life and your career you will have to repeatedly make similar versions of the same decision.\nFor these things it is a good idea to develop a ‘rule of thumb’ to follow.\nFor instance, if you are always analysing a certain type of data, then develop a robust approach to that type of analyse you plan on reusing.\nAnother good example is shopping for food (supermarkets are decision overload). You might have a rule of thumb that you buy the cheapest version of a given product, or the cheapest organic version if you are into organic food and so on.\n\n\n\nIf you copy yourself enough you will develop muscle memory. This is a very time and energy effective way to make decsions.\nFor instance, when I surf I don’t have to think about when to paddle for a wave and when to pop up onto my feet. I just know from having done it thousands of times.\nSome types of analysis also just flow out of my fingers into code without me thinking about it. This is because I have done them so many times.\nThe cost is that you have to invest extensive training into getting muscle memory. So it is only worthwhile doing this deliberately for decisions you think you will have to make very frequently.\n\n\n\nWhen someone asks you to do something, they are asking you to make decisions for them. This will cost you, because you are effectively trading off your time and energy for making other decisions.\nSo if you get asked to do things a lot, learn how to say ‘no’ gracefully. This book helped me with that.\n\n\n\nIf people are delegating decisions to you, why not delegate some of your decisions to someone else?\nEven better, if someone asks you to do something for them, ask for some decision making power in return.\nYou could ask them to do something, ask for their staff’s time to help you with something or ask for money to fund someone to help you.\n\n\n\nSometimes if you put off decisions, they will make themselves. Though this is not always an advisable hack.\nFor instance, if I put off choosing a house to buy I will never own a house. I would consider this a poor outcome.\nHowever, if I put off answering relatively unimportant emails I often find the problems resolve themselves.\n\n\n\nA sub-category of putting it off is sleeping on it. Particularly if you feel weary, your brain probably just needs a break from making decisions.\nShort naps during the day can help stretch out your decision making powers too.\n\n\n\nSometimes big decisions have to be made really fast. If so, you want to pre-approve the decision with yourself.\nFor instance, bidding on an auction for a house is pretty huge and stressful decision.\nThe way to solve this one is to have already decided you want the house and what you are willing to pay.\nThis means searching not for the ‘one ideal house’, because you may lose many auctions. Instead you should have a category of house types that you consider ‘suitable for living’. For instance, 3 bedroom houses in a local suburb.\nSo long as the type of house and the price remain within your parameters then you keep bidding. If the price exceeds your pre-approved boundaries, then you stop.\n\n\n\nMy final hack is to add some fun decisions to your day. If you have a day packed full of decisions, the fun decisions will push out some of the more stressful (and hopefully useless) ones.\nFor instance, I usually ride a fast road bike to work. I recently bought a mountain bike so I could have the flexibility to take different off-road routes on my commute.\nThis added decisions to my day - which bike should I ride and which trails should I take?\nWhen I ride home from work I often find I needlessly think about work the next day, when instead I should deal with the work decisions when I am actually in the office.\nNow when I ride home I find myself thinking about what trail to ride on and what bike to take.\nAs a result I get home more refreshed and less stressed."

    "section": "Plenary from Charles Birkeland",
    "text": "Plenary from Charles Birkeland\nBirkeland spoke about the success of fishery management in Palau and other Pacific Island nations.\nSuccess comes from making decisions on a rapid time-scale. Examples of management success come from places where fishers and regulators (often the same people!) don’t wait to confirm impacts, they act first, then establish impacts later.\n\n\n\nHow some of the #ICRS2016 followers on twitter feel about eating seafood. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nBirkeland said we often don’t need precautionary management, we need data-less management.\nAn example was night-time scuba spear fishing in Solomon Islands. Fishers came to the Governor and expressed concern that fish stocks were declining because of the spear fishing. Overnight, the Governor banned night time spear fishing.\nRapid management decisions in Palau and other nations are in contrast to fishers managed under western laws. For instance, in Guam action to reduce overfishing was a long and slow process, because the scientists pushing for changes had to work their way through the courts and have laws changed. In the meantime several fisheries were severely overexploited.\nBirkeland then explored the role of humans in coral reef food-webs. He argued that reef food-webs have relatively low productivity compared to other ecosystems. Therefore, fishing on reefs should be subsistence only.\nHe argued that coral reef food-webs are not exporting energy, they in fact use more energy than they can produce through benthic production. On reefs you often observe inverted biomass pyramids at any one instant in time. For instance, coral polyps are inverted biomass triangles - more biomass in animal cells than in algae - 5% is producers, 95% is animal.\nImportantly, reef food-webs must be importing energy and cannot sustain fishery exports\n\n\n\nWhy we shouldn’t eat reef fish - from Birkeland’s talk. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nBecause reef food-webs are importing energy they cannot sustain much fishing pressure. Palau can sustainably support local subsistence fishing, which is limited. Now the problem is feeding the tourists. E.g. Palau has about ~21 000 locals vs ~161 000 tourists annually. Birkeland argued therefore that we should feed the tourists pelagic fish.\nPelagic fish are faster growing and have higher reproductive potential at an early age than reef fish. For instance, yellow fin tuna are extremely fast growing and reach 30 pounds in their first year.\nThe experience in Palau was also that buying fish was also inefficient economically because they had to sell 5kg of locally caught fish to buy one small can of tuna. Therefore, the government banned export of reef fish.\nBirkeland moved on to explain how Palau is a world leader on reef management. For instance, they were the first nation to specify their EEZ to be a shark haven (in 2009). Many other Pacific Island countries have now followed suit.\n\n\n\nOrder of priorities for when we should eat tropical fish - from Birkeland’s talk. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nWe have seen some reef fish management successes in other nations. For instance, in West Hawaii they have a very successful fishery management council that has increased the total value of fishery value 4x over the last ~20 years. The success comes from good leadership (from Bill Walsh) and that the government backed up the formation of the fishery council.\nFurther, the fishers avoid taking the biggest fish - they primarily want intermediate sized fish for aquariums. Bigger fish produce exponentially more eggs, so this helps keep the fishery productive.\nBirkeland said we should ‘work with, not against coral reef fisheries’. Doing so requires (in a nutshell) village level management, saving the big fish, avoid exporting reef fish, keep the biggest slowest growing fish (e.g. humphead wrasse) for special events, encourage pelagic fish as food for tourists and put a cap on tourists, focus on high value tourism.\n\n\n\nSome of Birkeland’s take home messages. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nBirkeland’s talk was inspiring for its mix of lessons learned from Palau and the important role of reef ecology in understanding management success and failures. Let’s hope that other nations can follow Palau’s example in implementing more successful reef fishery management for the future."

    "text": "Watershed impacts on coral reefs\nQuantifying the impacts of land-based stresses to coral reefs is challenging reef scientists to get out of the water and head up onto the land. One of the key challenges is just figuring out where pollutants come from. In the watershed impacts session we saw a number of innovative techniques presented for tracing pollutants to its sources.\nTracing pollutants will help management identify locations where action is needed, such as improving waste water treatment.\nMost from The Nature Conservancy is tracing sewage pollutants to a reef in Hawaii. Corals on the reef have been in decline over several years. They used a technique that is new to marine systems - Microbial source tracking. They took water samples and grew the bacteria. They then used genetic techniques to detect the presence of human gut bacteria.\nBy combining the microbial source tracking with other tracing techniques, they were able to show that groundwater is transporting sewage onto coral reefs, resulting in coral disease and growth deformities. They then developed maps of their water quality indicators to create a map to communicate the results to the community.\nPait spoke about numerous pollutants in the Virgin Islands that are occurring at levels above those recommended for human consumption. These include metals from boat yards and chemicals like PCBs. This information fed directly into the local watershed management plan.\nLewis will be reconstructing land-use change in Palau using evidence from coral skeletons. She is also using novel evidence sources too, like the number of permits for annually allocated for heavy machinery. She is starting her dissertation, so we look forwards to hearing more as her work progresses."

    "title": "International Coral Reef Symposium Day 2",
    "section": "Informing management decisions",
    "text": "Informing management decisions\nCoral reef scientists are increasingly branching out to use decision science to help communicate the actions we need to take to conserve reefs to managers.\nThis session was packed, standing room only, indicating the interest in the science of managing reefs.\nA key insight from this session was developing science to provide direct advice to managers. We need to do more than document declines, we need to show how we can reverse them.\nBut a challenge to achieving effective decision science is obtaining sufficient data to evaluate the effectiveness of management actions. For instance, we need monitoring that is designed to establish whether management actions are slowing or reverse declines (see Ahmadia’s talk from yesterday)\n\n\n\nKen Anthony on managing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nAnother key emphasis was on managing local stressors (e.g. nutrients) in the face of climate change, which can’t be managed locally. (A problem Cote, Darling and I explain in more detail here).\nIn fact, Global vs local stressors was the theme of the morning’s session.\nKen Anthony from Australian Institute of Marine Sciences spoke about the importance of acting to save reefs, even with imperfect scientific information. He spoke about how uncertainty can paralyse decision makers into not taking any action. We need to recognise that not taking acting is a decision in itself.\nHoegh-Guldberg spoke about the global risk of climate change to coral reefs. He said we need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees to avoid massive degradation of coral reefs - less than the current policy target of 2 degrees. In the meantime we need to do what we can to sustain ecosystems through local management while the climate stablises.\nMcleod from The Nature Conservancy started with a quote: ‘insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting the same result’. We keep telling ourselves that if we design protected areas well enough, we will ensure reef resilience to climate change. But reefs continue to decline.\n\n\n\nHoegh-Guldberg on global warming. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nMcleod was asked by a journalist if it is true that incorporating resilience into management is making a difference to the health of reefs. She admitted that she stumbled. We don’t yet have the data to evaluate if resilience management is working, even though we have been working on these issues for over a decade.\nShe argued that to justify our efforts we need to establish whether ‘resilience management’ is working, or not.\nThe written word can’t communicate what how compelling a speaker Mcleod is. She had no slides but the audience was enwrap. Anthony joked at the completion of her talk that he would vote for her if she ran for president.\nMcleod finished early and there were numerous questions. Someone (Maria Beger?) asked what is the difference between resilience management and normal management. Mcleod answered that resilience management has a specific focus on ecosystem function, not just the stresses, including actions like protecting herbivorous fish on coral reefs.\nSalm from The Nature Conservancy started by emphasising that we often don’t have the time to do the science to support decisions when working with local governance. He asked how much science is enough and how much is too much?\n\n\n\nQuote from Salm. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nSalm said we need science to be designed to be nimble so it can feed into governance structures. One way to do this is to involve local people and tourists in data collection. This can help us get the data we need to evaluate whether management is working.\nHe gave an example of how very straightforward science - involving community monitoring of species recovering in protected areas - had convinced the community that they need more protected areas to aid recovery of overfished species.\nJill Harris from WWF started with a great summary of how conservation prioritisation works. Managers have limited resources, so we need to target management efforts for protection at areas where the management actions will have the greatest benefits.\nTo prioritise management actions to maximise their effectiveness, we will often want to target areas with the greatest local threats (that can be managed) and avoid areas threatened by climate change (which can’t be managed locally).\nHarris looked at level of threat across protected areas in Indonesia and showed protection is biased towards reefs that have lower potential for management benefits.\nHarris also highlighted the importance of considering the local situation. They identified priority areas for protection, but also considered what type of management was most likely to work given local context.\nNick Wolff (University of Queensland and recently moved to The Nature Conservancy) started by describing how science is portraying a very bad story for decline of the Great Barrier Reef. In contrast, Australian Government policy documents are very optimistic that management of fisheries and catchments can secure the future health of the reef.\nWolff is using novel methods to establish the degree that local management can influence the future health of the reef. Stay tuned for his upcoming publications.\nApproaches to decision problems\nA key theme emerging in the afternoon was how to communicate more nuanced messages about coral reef conservation to the public and policy-makers. There is wide-spread concern that the key points of science may often be lost once it is communicated outside the scientific community.\nKareiva (current chief scientist of The Nature Conservancy) started his talk with the message box, a tool to help scientists communicate their science. He said that it was a good start, but that it may miss key points that scientists often want to communicate: thresholds, impact and uncertainty.\nAs an example of why thresholds and uncertainty are important, he recommended you read about this experiment. The experiment shows that if the threshold for a disaster is uncertain, multiple players fail to come to a collective agreement.\nHe hypothesised that unfortunately, science often gets boiled down into one of three stories that are then communicated to the public:\n\nIt’s not as bad as you think, we’re ok\nIt’s really bad and we need to change everything\nIts worse than you think, we are doomed\n\nIf we want to communicate more sophisticated messages, we need to understand how public, media, policy-makers read our papers an interpret them. Kareiva said this will be the focus on ongoing work.\n\n\n\nSource: http://twitter.com\n\n\nPandolfi led his talk by asking how can we communicate a more nuanced message of science to the public?\nFor instance, as a good example, Pandolfi gives the media communication of the 2016 coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. There has been widespread bleaching and coral mortality, but the pattern is spatially variable, with some areas hit harder than others. However, even in those areas that had been spared severe bleaching mortality, coral health is poor. Pandolfi contended that the nuances in this event were well represented in the media.\nHe wants us to think more about how to communicate uncertainty to the public.\nCrow White from CalPoly wants us to use ‘trade-off analysis’ to understand how to balance multiple objectives for ocean management. He gives four steps to developing a trade-off analysis:\n\nDevelop models of ocean uses\nEstimate sector responses to alternate forms of management\nCompare outcomes of management in relation to management\nIdentify management strategy that maximises positive benefits to all sectors.\n\nTrade-offs analysis can help us find compromise solutions for management of multiple sectors that are often better than the status-quo. They can thus be useful for communicating science to decision makers and stakeholders.\nKirstin Oleson and Megan Barnes and from the University of Hawaii are using trade-off analysis to identify optimal actions for managing sediment impacts on coral reefs. Importantly, unsealed roads in the tropics are a key source of sediments to coral reefs. There are too many roads to seal them all, so managers need to identify priorities to seal to avoid sediment impacts.\nTrade-off analysis let them identify the optimal strategy for road repair across a range of budgets for road repair. They are now applying this approach to a broader range of land-use management activities.\nAbdulla talked about resilience management in the Maldives. Growing tourism is increasing pressure on reef fisheries to feed tourists. People are also switching to fishing herbivorous fish because other species are depleted.\nThe Maldives are remote, but unprotected, with 0.04% reserve coverage. They are looking at marine managed areas as an approach to management, rather than no-take areas, which are unlikely to be effective in the region. Due to the spatial spread of communities and reefs the effective management requires a decentralized approach.\nLaurance McCook talked about how to operationalize the precautionary principle for management of coral reefs. He presented a convincing case for an approach that better communicates and uncertainty for decision-makers, especially when there are divergent scientific views.\nHe gave an example of dredging impacts on the Great Barrier Reef. A key step was to convene a panel of experts that represented the range of views on impacts of a new development. This meant they could clarify what the panel agreed and did not agree on and make more rapid progress in the debate. It also enabled them to prioritise future research efforts on the unknown impacts.\nI have learned some important lessons on communicating my science to decision makers from this session. I hope I can carry these through to my own work.\nThat’s all from me today. Tomorrow I will be co-chairing a symposium on Ridge to Reef management approaches, so hope to see you there.\nMistakes in this blog, thoughts on this blog, want me to add or remove something? If you have anything to say, feel free to email me."

    "text": "Ambitious restoration of mangroves and seagrasses could lead to substantial recovery of these ecosystems new research has found.\nPublished in Current Biology, the study estimated potential recovery of mangroves and seagrass under a range of protection and restoration strategies for 2030, 2050 and 2070, milestone years for international biodiversity commitments, and beyond.\n“Protection alone is unlikely to drive sufficient recovery,” said Dr Christina Buelow from the Global Wetlands Project and the Griffith University Coastal and Marine Research Centre.\n“Our research suggests that if ambitious action is taken to both protect and restore, gains of up to 5% for mangroves and 35% for seagrasses could be achieved by 2050.\n“There is an urgent need to halt and reverse loss of mangroves and seagrass to continue to benefit from the services these ecosystems provide to coastal communities, such as enhancing coastal resilience and contributing to climate stability.”\nConservation action is needed to maintain and recover mangrove and seagrass ecosystems world-wide, but until now the expected outcomes of different protection and restoration strategies has remained unclear.\n“Pairing global observations of mangrove and seagrass coverage change through time with modelled changes we demonstrated that only protection and restoration combined can support substantial gains in coverage of these ecosystems into the future,” said Professor Rod Connolly, Director of the Coastal and Marine Research Centre and the Global Wetlands Project.\n“Our research can be used to set global conservation targets for coastal ecosystem recovery that are not only scientifically-sound, but are also have the necessary ambition required to inspire coordinated international action,” he said.\nAssociate Professor Chris Brown, also from The Global Wetlands Project and the Coastal and Marine Research Centre, added that “we need to be really ambitious if we are going to fight climate change and save coastal ecosystems.”\n“Imagine if we put the kind of effort we are putting into space programs into protecting the Earth’s ecosystems – that’s what I mean by being ambitious.\n“We need to save Earth’s ecosystems from the unprecedented scale of human pressures they face and help secure the stable climate that humanity needs to thrive.\n“Our research provides the scientific basis to predict the outcomes we can expect for these ecosystems if they are ambitious. We hope this helps motivate action towards international targets for ecosystem protection, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which envisions a future where humans live in harmony with nature.”"

    "title": "Correcting for confounded variables with GLMs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "General (and generalized) linear models can be useful for analyzing field data, where sampling is often distributed unevenly across different environmental gradients or treatment groups. They help us correct for confounded gradients and discover effects that are hidden in plots of raw data.\nFor instance, we used GLMs in a meta-analysis of the rates species are shifting their ranges under climate change. We used the GLMs to correct for differences in ways different studies had measured species ranges, so we could then study the unique effects of ecological variables.\nYou can also think of these GLMs with multiple covariates as ‘statistically’ (rather than experimentally) controlling for the effects of each variable when looking at the effects of the other variables.\nIn this post I’ll demonstrate this application for statistical controls with a simple example of fish abundance observed in two regions.\n\n\n\nWe’ll start by simulating some data. Let’s say the data represent fish abundance at sites. Fish vary in the area of fish habitat available at that site. There are also two bioregions we’ve sampled. We’ll assume the fish only occur on one bioregion, even though habitat is available in both bioregions.\nWe’ll assume data are poisson distributed, to account for the fact that fish numbers can’t be &lt;0, and that they should be integers.\nTo simulate the data we will specify an intercept and an habitat effect b_habitat. We’ll assume two bioregions, so we only need to specify one bioregion effect (which is the mean difference from bioregion B and A)\nnsites &lt;- 88\n\n#Effects\nintercept &lt;- 0\nb_habitat &lt;- 1\nb_region &lt;- -20\nThen we need to make up the covariate data.\nset.seed(50)\nregion &lt;- c(rep(0, nsites/2), rep(1, nsites/2))\n\nhabitat_area &lt;- rnorm(nsites, 1.5, 0.5)\nhabitat_area &lt;- habitat_area*(region + 1)\nWe made it so habitat area was on average twice as big in the second region.\nNow assemble a ‘design matrix’ (X) and matrix of effects (ie our ). These help us then make predictions of mean abundance with a simple matrix multiplication:\ncoefs_true &lt;- matrix(c(intercept, b_habitat, b_region))\nX &lt;- matrix(cbind(1, habitat_area, region), ncol = 3)\nNow make the ‘true’ means for our simulation and the fish abundance data:\ny_mean &lt;- exp(X %*% coefs_true)\ny &lt;- rpois(nsites, y_mean)\nWe took an exponent to ensure positive values.\nIf this confuses you so far, you can read more about linear models and then generalized linear models on my other blogs.\n\n\n\nplot(habitat_area, y)\n\nSo not strong evidence of any effect of habitat area on abundance. What about if we colour points by bioregion?\nplot(habitat_area, y, col = region + 1)\n\nSo it appears the red region (the region with 1 in the region variable) has not habitat relationship, whereas the black region (region with 0 in region variable) has a positive relationship. This occurs because we set the region intercept to -20 (and a poisson with mean exp(-20) will predict basically always zero).\n\n\n\nNow let’s fit a GLM assuming we don’t know about bioregion\nm1 &lt;- glm(y ~ habitat_area, family = \"poisson\")\nsummary(m1)\n\n##\n## Call:\n## glm(formula = y ~ habitat_area, family = \"poisson\")\n##\n## Deviance Residuals:\n##    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  \n## -3.071  -1.783  -1.281   0.229   7.194  \n##\n## Coefficients:\n##              Estimate Std.

It is saying there are fewer fish with more habitat. This is because the second region has on average twice as much habitat, but our fish doesn’t ever occur there.\nTo see this, we can do a plot with the visreg package:\nlibrary(visreg)\nvisreg(m1, scale = \"response\")\n\nSo predicting an effect of habitat area that decreases with habitat area.\n\n\n\nOk, so now try including region:\nm2 &lt;- glm(y ~ habitat_area + region, family = \"poisson\")\nsummary(m2)\n\n##\n## Call:\n## glm(formula = y ~ habitat_area + region, family = \"poisson\")\n##\n## Deviance Residuals:\n##      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max  \n## -2.43472  -0.26179  -0.00006  -0.00002   2.46518  \n##\n## Coefficients:\n##               Estimate Std.

Note also the effect size (0.885) is within the error bounds (SE = 0.132) for the true effect size (=1). Let’s also confirm our better model (most parsimonious) with the AIC (you can read more about what the AIC is on this blog).\nAIC(m1, m2)\n\n##    df      AIC\n## m1  2 501.2268\n## m2  3 203.4282\nSo there’s basically no evidence for the model without bioregion compared to the model with that effect.\nBut notice that the region effect is approximately correct (-23), but the standard error is huge and, consequently, the region effect is non-signficant (p = 0.99). This happens because the abundance is always zero in region 2, so the poisson model can’t get a good estimate of the mean abundance. Put another way, the poisson must have mean &gt;0, but it can’t distinguish between a mean of 0.000000001 versus say 0.0001 (they both predict basically all zeros), so the SE are very broad.\nWe see this if we do a plot, and habitat area appears insignificant:\nvisreg(m2, xvar = \"habitat_area\")\n\nNow replot the predictions, asking for habitat area just in the first bioregion (labelled 0 in the data):\nvisreg(m2, xvar = \"habitat_area\",\n       cond = list(region = 0), scale = \"response\")\n\nNow we see the trend.\nSo our GLM has corrected for the absence of fish in bioregion 2 and correctly identified the positive relationship between abundance and fish biomass. The GLM with the region effect also gets the magnitude of the trend approximately correct (within the margin of error from the true value)."

    "text": "Emotions associated with learning to program\nSome common feelings new users report are:\n\nFrustration\nAnger\nIntrigue\nElation\nBewilderment\n\nAll of these emotions, whether you see them as ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ can actually motivate or demotivate us. Let me give two examples.\nElation is commonly described as a ‘positive’ emotion, which is usually associated with cracking a difficult programming problem. For instance, maybe you just got your linear regression model to work and the results look really interesting.\nElation can motivate you to keep trying new things, because it is rewarding. It can also be demotivating. If you have prematurally declared a problem solved, the feeling of elation may mean you miss a mistake, or a better solution.\nFrustration is probably the most common feeling I hear about (as a teacher of R). Frustration can be demotivating - “I just can’t fix this!”. Or it can be motivating - “I need to get this fixed and I’m not getting up until I do”. In fact for me, frustration is often a driving force behind solving difficult coding problems. Frustration motivates me to keep trying until its solved."

But knowing you are perhaps over-excited, you stop yourself before you send the results straight to your supervisor. You realise you need to double check that the data were entered correctly and that the model fits the data appropriately before you can be confident in sharing your conclusions.\nFrustration as a motivating force can also be a trap. It is helpful to realise when frustration is driving you too hard to try and solve a problem.\nOften you will find that the solution ‘just comes to you’, as soon as you step away from the computer, perhaps to take a stroll.\nFrustration can also lead you into a pointless dogfight with small bugs, causing you to lose sight of the bigger picture. A good example is the Folk Theorem of Statistical computing:\n\n“When you have computational problems, often there’s a problem with your model” Andrew Gelman\n\nI have often run across this issue when I am trying to fit standard models (e.g. GLMs) to new types of data.

However, at a deeper level, learning to programming means finding ways to keep yourself motivated enough to keep trying. So I think, before we consider technical advice, we need to think about what will keep people going.\nSo here is the tweet-worth of advice I posted:\n\nLearning to code is emotional- frustration, joy, boredom… Find yourself a support network of like minded coders to keep motivated\n\nHaving other people who can help you is great, not only because you can pool thoughts to solve problems, but because they can be empathetic to your challenges. Sometimes having some understanding is all you need to keep going and solve a coding problem.\nI will end this post on piece of advice posted by the person (Brian P. Hogan) that asked the question above, I think its telling:\n\n“Software dev is 20% code and 80% people. Level up communication skills and show love to everyone.” Brian P.

    "section": "",
    "text": "How to create a culture of using R programming at your institution\nPromoting the use of the R programming language at your institution can bring many benefits. Your colleagues will be able to access cutting edge statistical analyses that have just been developed. It can improve flexibility in data-analysis, allowing the combination of old tools to invent new methods. Proficient R programming can also save a lot of time, because the scripts you create are a repeatable blueprint of your analysis. Scripting is also a key skill for dealing with very large datasets, that are unmanageable using point and click interfaces. Finally, Rstats is fast becoming the gold standard for analysis and many academic journals encourage submission of Rstats code with manuscripts, particularly for papers about new methods.\nR is somewhat infamous for it’s steep learning curve. If you are new to R, getting started can be very daunting and you will want help. So how can you create a ‘culture’ of using R in our institutions? Here I describe some of the lessons I have learned about creating a culture of R.\n\n1. Run an introductory course on R\nHaving an experienced instructor teach a course on how to get started with R can be the best way to start. Many people may not have encountered a programming language before, so just opening up the R program can be daunting - they don’t know where to start. An instructed course is a great way to step people through this process.\nYou can make a lot of progress learning R in just one day, for instance see some of the introductory courses I run.\nThe best courses will be tailored to your research discipline. I find that people ‘get it’ better if they are solving problems they will encounter in their own work. When I was learning R, I learned less from text books that worked from medical examples when compared to texts that worked from ecological examples.\nSo recruit a local R user to teach a course for your institution. Getting someone local will also help build a support network and will help ensure they are familiar with the problems faced in your discipline.\n\n\n2. Create an R support network at your institution\nA support network is key. People will typically be using R on their own. When they run across problems they will need help. R’s help files are not that useful, until you learn to speak the language - they tend to have a lot of stats and programming jargon in them. Web searches are also difficult, until you know the right terms to search for. Also, help files and web searches have no empathy. Often what aspiring R programmers need is a friendly and encouraging ear to vent their frustrations on!\nThere are a few ways to create good support networks, try some or all of these:\n\nAn introductory R course is a great way for new R users to meet and can create the beginnings of an R community\nAn email group is also helpful. R users can ask for help on their problems and share useful articles and advice they come across as they learn R. Of course the normal etiquette of group email lists applies.\nOrganise regular meet-ups where R users come with their problems and a solution is crowd sourced. Ideally, some experienced R users will attend too. I have attended/organised several of these over the years and find they are great for my own knowledge. By participating and helping people new to R I get a greater exposure to the types of statistical problems ecologists need to solve. One of the most enjoyable R groups I have attended was the Stats-Beerz group at Simon Fraser University. They combine a casual R programming help session with craft beers (which I think proves that R is the language of choice for hipsters).\n\n\n\n3. Focus training at the junior levels\nThe junior staff and students typically have the most time to learn new skills. They are also usually the people collecting, entering and analysing data. Focus R training at these people. They are most likely to integrate R into their work habits. That said, if more senior staff want to learn R, then certainly encourage that too. Presence of senior staff at R courses and meet-ups sends a message that R programming is an important skill to learn.\n\n\n4. Promote an R friendly computing environment\nSome institutions I have worked at in the past did not allow installation of 3rd party software on the institute’s computers without IT support. Once you install R, you will probably want to download and install new packages as new problems arise or you want to try a new type of analysis. Requiring an IT staff member to help install every new R package you want is very frustrating and really slows down the process of problem solving in R. Hopefully these days are over, but if your institute requires IT support to install new software, you need to fight against it.\n\n\n5. Promote R at all levels\nSenior staff need to see value in their staff and students using R to allow a productive R culture to develop. In a successful R culture, senior staff may not know how to use R themselves, but they will be encouraging junior staff and students to be using R in their work. Senior staff also typically have more access to the resources required to provide R training and facilitate support networks. In my experience most senior staff already see the value in R. If you want to develop an R culture at your institution, all you need do is approach them with ideas for training.\nGood luck with developing an R programming culture for your institute. A successful R culture will benefit you and your colleagues for years to come."

    "title": "Tips for providing written feedback to students",
    "section": "",
    "text": "If you are a supervisor or teacher you will need to provide written feedback to students. This is a skill that takes time to develop. Here are some tips I’ve developed over the years. As a student there are also ways you can encourage better feedback from your supervisors.\nIt helps to read some books like Schimel’s book on ‘writing papers that get cited and grants that get funded’ or Steven Pinker ‘Sense of Style’. These give you the words to describe what is wrong and how to fix it (before those books I new a sentence could be improved and I knew how to improve it, but I couldn’t explain to the student why or how to do it).\n\nJust as cooks, musicians and ballplayers have to master some lingo to be able to share their tips and learn from others, so writers can benefit by knowing the names of materials they work with and how they do their jobs.\n\nSteven Pinker - Sense of Style\n\nTips for supervisors\nProvide comments on their writing rather than just editing. Explain why it doesn’t work and how it can be improved.\nRemember to give positive criticism as well. saying ‘good’ is ok, but that’s harder for the student to interpret. Better to use encouragement like ‘After reading this I now understand X for the first time, thankyou!’ or ‘what helped me understand this was that you broke a complex idea down into several smaller ideas in separate sentences’.\nOn the flip side, if you think something is wrong with the writing, don’t just leave a vague comment like ‘vague’. Explain what is wrong and how it can be improved. Even if you are not sure what is wrong, you can still leave a comment like: “I found this sentence hard to understand, can you explain in plain words what you mean?”.\nFocus on big picture of ideas and overall structure first. Once that is good then narrow in on things like grammar and sentence structure (though sometimes the sentences are so bad you do need to fix those so you can understand what the ideas are). Therefore I encourage starting with outlines of topic sentences.\nActually a common problem is not having topic sentences, outlining can help with that.\nEncourage your student to send you lots of small bits of writing often, rather than you spending 2 hours editing a draft once every few months. Lots of small changes are easier to learn than getting dumped with heaps of comments all at once.\nNotice common mistakes and problems and point them out to the student, along with a solution. These are often the areas where they can make the fastest improvements.\nIts common that you’ll have to show them something several times before they learn. That’s just part of the process. Be patient.\nWhen they are stressed or time poor they may default back to bad habits, so just talk about that with them when you notice it, like “I noticed you are doing XXX again, what’s going on for you right now?”\nSometimes sloppy writing can be a sign of a deeper issue, such as stress about a deadline or a personal issue. Noticing early warning signs of stress and anxiety will help you better support your students.\nIts ok to leave some mistakes or areas of improvement until next time. You don’t have to rip apart every draft and smother it in red corrections.\nRemember academic culture is a culture of criticism. But our natural tendency is to to require five positive comments to offset a single negative comment. So it might take some time for your student to get used to extensive criticism on a draft. This is why I prefer to only provide a handful of criticisms (with improvements of course) per draft. (and to request frequent small amounts of editing, rather than ‘all at once’).\n\n\nTips for getting good feedback\nIf you are seeking feedback, then there are some ways you can encourage feedback that is more useful.\nRead the books I mentioned above and practice the advice they give.\nIt helps to tell your supervisor (or collaborator) what you want. Rather than sending a whole draft, send them part of a draft. Or if you do send the whole draft let them know what you specifically want feedback on. For instance, the overall structure, the methodological approach, the relevant literature, or the grammar and writing style.\nIts faster for them if they just need to comment on one aspect. Be sure to let them know in the email, so they are more likely to respond quickly. Lots of small chunks of feedback are also easier for you to learn from.\nRather than saying “I want feedback on X, Y and Z aspects of my draft” you can say “how can I improve X, Y and Z aspects of my draft?” This will encourage constructive feedback. Someone could legitimately respond to the first question with a list of things that are wrong. Whereas, for the second question you are asking them to tell you how you can improve.\nYou can also ask “what have I done really well in this draft?” to encourage positive feedback. Other ways of asking this question are: “how did this help you understand my topic?”, “what did you learn from reading this draft?”\nYou can also encourage chunking of your feedback by asking questions like “what is the most important thing I can do to improve this draft?” or “what is the most important thing I can do to improve my writing?”, or “what are three things I should focus on first?”\nEncourage them when they give you helpful feedback! Supervisors are often still learning how to give feedback. It’s really helped me that my students have told me when my feedback has helped, and how it helped them."

For instance, if its conservation planning, then look in Conservation Letters, Conservation Biology and Biological Conservation.\nMake sure you read the new and old literature. One way to identify very influential older papers is to sort results of a lit search by citation count. When you start your PhD you have your chance to read some of the classics. You probably won’t feel you have time to read this sort of thing later on (though don’t let me hold you back if you want to!).\nAsk your peers for their favourite papers to read.\nFollow up on citations.

By this I mean actually listen to what other people are saying, rather than thinking about what you will say when other people talk.\n\nEngaging the participants\nEngaging everyone helps everyone feel heard and helps get contributions from all participants.\nShow other people you are listening: eye contact, nodding, hand gestures.\nReflect back to people what they’ve just said. This is active listening. For instance, if Alice described how she was satisified with the progress on the project” you could respond “Thanks Alice, I see that you’re happy with how the project is going” (rather than just nodding).\nDraw in people, especially the quiet ones. For instance, if Selena describes an issue she is having with the data analysis on the project you could hand it over to Takuya: “Takuya, I know you’ve written about network modelling, do you have experiences from that work you could share to help Selena”\nIf you don’t know their backgrounds that is ok to! You can just ask someone to reflect like: “Takuya, what do you think about what Selena just said” or “Takuya, can you describe the problem Selena is having in your own words?”\nThis reflection opportunity can be helpful to engage people, but also see problems from different perspectives.\nIf you start asking people to reflect on each other’s comments, everyone will pay more attention to what is being said.\n\n\nYou don’t need to have all the answers!\nA common mistake as facilitator is to think you need to answer the questions that are posed. Then the facilitator ends up talking with their own answers. You don’t answer them.\nYou are there to help the group find a solution. So if a problem/question comes up, use your facilitator skills to kick it onto someone else like “Muhammad, what do you think about Maria’s question?”\nIf the group solves a problem, even if you knew the answer, then you are doing successful facilitation."

    "text": "Dealing with problems\n\nPeople who talk too much\nThe tactful way is to smoothly transition the conversation away from them, by taking over their sentences. Its hard to put this in text but here goes:\nOvertalker: “What I’m talking about is the absolute lack of data in…” Facilitator (finishes the sentence) “the models. That’s a really important insight John. I’d like to pass on to Eva for her perspective on this issue”.\nBut this is partly highly cultural. e.g. in some cultures the senior members need to be let to speak as much as they want, in other cultures it might be more appropriate to let minority groups speak first. Some cultures this is fast and seamless. Others you would leave a long pause between sentences.\n\n\nPeople who talk too much in online meetings\nThis is really difficult. And we all tend to overtalk in online meetings because we aren’t getting as much visual feedback from our participants! If you have advice let me know. A couple tips:\n\nGet cameras turned on so people get more visual feedback.\nBe engaged, overstate your body language (nodding etc…) so the speaker knows you are listening\nUse emoticons and reactions\n\nSometimes I just talk over them like in the ‘people who talk too much’ example. The key thing is to show you’ve heard by reflecting their thoughts back to them in your own words. If you abruptly change topics it may seem rude.\n\n\nPeople who don’t engage or who are shy\nSee notes above about engaging particpants. Just try to be aware of who they are and keep a mental checklist of who is doing the talking.\n\n\nTransitioning the conversation\nWhat to do if the conversation is going in the wrong direction, or you are running out of time?\nFollow above advice for people who talk too much to transition the conversation to where you want it to go.\nJust remember to acknowledge the person you are taking the platform from. A bad example\n“So we are running out of time, let’s move on”\nGood example:\n“Thanks for those important insights Anya. I think we need to follow-up to properly explore those ideas. Now I’d like to just take us back to the agenda…”\n\n\nStrong emotions and conflict\nSometimes people express anger, frustration or deep sadness in meetings. Sometimes there is conflict that goes beyond healthy collegial debate. These situations can be difficult and need to be treated case-by-case, particularly if they involve ongoing issues in group dynamics.\nThe only general point I can make is to acknowledge the feelings. For example, you could say, “Rachael, are you feeling angry about what was just said?”\nThis helps the person feel heard. But also helps you take the floor back from the conflict.\nHow you go from there depends on the situation. If its sadness (like a colleague drops the news that they lost a friend recently) and you are in a supportive group, you could offer condolences and reflections as a group, just generally show kindness.\nIf its serious conflict yuo might like to ask the person to come outside for a private chat (and delegate facilitation to someone else while you are gone).\nI’ll leave that there, as I am no expert on conflict resolution."

So its still good for you as facilitator to raise their points like: “Ahhh, I see Caitie has asked a great question online, Alyssa she wants to know if…”\nIf it is simultaneously online and in person you need an ‘online’ faciliator to help bring in those people (remind you, monitor chat, perhaps talk to online participants directly)\nCameras on is better for engagement\nResist the temptation to check your email when other people are talking (I once did this with screen sharing on, oops). You need to be engaged and staying present."

    "text": "New fellowship: Discovery Early Career Research Award\nI am pleased to announce I was awarded a national fellowship from the Australian Research Council recently. I will be funded through to 2018 to pursue a new research direction in the impacts of habitat change on fisheries. My funding also includes a PhD scholarship, so I will be advertising for a PhD student soon. Get in touch if you are interested in modelling of marine ecosystems.\nHere is an excerpt from my project proposal.\nSustaining fisheries is important for economies, livelihoods and human health, but globally numerous fisheries are threatened by rapid loss of aquatic habitat. The role of habitat in fishery declines is poorly quantified, and we need new models that integrate existing datasets to attribute change in a fishery to change in its habitats. The project will develop a new statistical analysis to examine the role of habitat loss in the global status of fisheries. Subsequently, novel numerical techniques will be used to explore how multiple human impacts to habitats affect fisheries. These approaches will be used to predict how human impacts to habitats affect fisheries through time and space."

There’s project design, institutional support statement, budget, budget justification, industry partner support letters (for some grants), investigator career opportunities, investigator career impact, investigator citation metrics, … it goes on and on.\nI can see how applications have become so complex. All the sections are there to make sure the assessors fairly consider all aspects of your project design and career track record. They are also there to make sure that spending of public money is well justified.\nFor instance, in an ARC you’ll write a ‘research opportunity performance evaluation’, where you can talk about your best research outcomes, but also how breaks in your career may have slowed you down."

I had tenure for some of these application.\nI have a young family, so my time outside of work hours is significantly constrained. This meant I had to be very organized. But I did have the luxury of a job that paid me to write grants.\nMany early career researchers and researchers who are trying to return to science after a career break don’t have this luxury. This may mean they need to write the application on their own time, either because they’ve don’t have an academic job, or their present job doesn’t allow time for grant writing.\nI’ve also seen the process suck the soul out of people. Here’s a common situation: a postdoc’s research contract is ending soon and their supervisor doesn’t have ongoing funding for their position. So they write for an early career fellowship.\nBut chances are the postdoc won’t win the grant (the overall success rate is about 15-20%) and the time invested in the application is time lost from chasing up other higher probability job opportunities.\nThe stress of this situation is amplified by uncertainty about when the grant will actually be announced.\nSo, if you are going to play a high stakes game, it’s a good idea to have a reliable plan B."

This would save researcher time (also often paid for by public money!) and make grant writing more accessible to those who are disadvantaged by not having sufficient time.\nFrom what I’ve seen of the Discovery grant applications in Canada, they are far simpler than Australian Discovery grants.\nThis year a petition from ARC tracker was signed by hundreds of researchers. Some of the recommendations in the petition included simplifying the grant application process.\nOf course, the simplification would have to be done carefully so that other types of bias aren’t amplified (like those relating to performance relative to career opportunity).\nAnother approach is to use ‘grant lotteries’, where funding is allocated randomly to a pool of grants that are deemed fundable. That way you can have a shorter application that has to tick off on some minimal standards. Then leave the rest to an unbiased lottery.\nTo sum up, as grant applications become increasingly complex, it increasingly favours people with the time and support networks to develop the application. This means good researchers with great ideas who don’t get the time will be at a disadvantage. That isn’t in the interest of high quality science."

    "section": "Asking good questions",
    "text": "Asking good questions\nWe first discussed some of the different types of questions the team had observed at seminars.\nMany felt that a good question should be an actual genial question about the science that was presented. Some of the lab members related times they had heard ‘questions’ which were actually comments or comments shallowly framed as questions. Sometimes the person in the audience just wants to talk about their own work. If that is the case, they should wait till their own seminar or leave the point for discussion after the seminar rather than stating it in the presenter’s question time.\nA style of question that can be difficult for the presenter to interpret is when the questioner is unsure of their question, so they speak to figure out what their actual question is. One lab member had noticed that people taking notes during seminars tended to have better frame questions. So taking notes can help you come up with a clearer question.\nGood questions often start with a compliment to this presenter will stop this helps put the presenter at ease, especially if it’s a difficult question that they might feel defensive about.\ne.g. “That was a very clear explanation of how dentrification operates in mangroves thankyou. I wonder though how much error there is in denitrification measurements made using the isotope method and if these errors could affect your conclusion that denitrification rates are greater in mangroves than other coastal wetlands?”\nA compliment that contains a short amount of context about the question can also help jog both the presenter and the audience’s minds about which aspect of the presentation this question relates to.\nAnother style of question that some team members have enjoyed our questions that suggests you directions of research.\ne.g. “I didn’t realize mangroves could remove nitrogen pollution from the water, I wonder if we could also apply your methods to measure nitrogen mitigation in seagrass meadows?”\nLab members also related bad questions they had heard, including questions that were about the presenter’s personal appearance or other aspects that didn’t relate to the science they were presenting.\nAnother style of questioning that can come off badly is to doggedly pursue the same question over and over. One example was a presenter that was questioned on the robustness of the t-tests they had used. The presenter answered that they were the correct method, however the audience member kept following up with more and more questions insisting that the t-tests were incorrectly applied. It became clear that the presenter didn’t have sufficient expertise to answer these statistical questions. In such a situation it would have been more appropriate for the questioner to discuss it further with the presenter after the seminar finished."

    "text": "Responding to difficult questions\nWe also practised asking difficult questions of each other and answering those.\nSome tips for difficult questions include thanking the questioner and asking to discuss the topic later after the seminar. For a question you’re not sure about you could admit that you’re not sure about the answer and offer to look into it and follow up with the questioner later on.\nWhat you should avoid is trying to dodge a question you don’t know the answer to. It will be obvious to the audience that you are bullshitting.\nIt’s important to remember that we are scientists not politicians. This means we don’t have to know everything, we are allowed to be wrong and we allowed to change our minds in the face of new evidence. So if someone points out a legitimate flaw in your research during question time you’re allowed to agree with them. In fact, the sign of a good scientist is that they know the limits of their own knowledge.\nResponding to difficult questions, especially questions that catch you off guard or sound antagonistic, takes practise. So I recommend you doing a mock ‘questions time’ that includes some tough questions, with your colleagues or lab group so you can practice.\nFor instance, one mock question I asked one lab member about their work with an industry partner was along the lines of an accusation: “your work is just helping this industry green-wash their dirty operations”. He answered: “In our work we are engaging with stakeholders on all sides of this contentious issue. The scientific process is helping improve the transparency of industry operations and create a dialogue between different sides.”\nComing up with well-framed answers to difficult questions can take thought, so it is worth practising for your specific topic."

I once heard an academic tell a group of early-career researchers that 90 hour work weeks were neccessary to make it. But various studies have shown that people tend to exaggerate their true work hours.\nFor instance, in a recent interview with Indra Nooyi (CEO of Pepsi co), she claimed to sleep just 4 hours a night and work 20 hour days 7 days a week. In the same interview she also talks about playing a daily match of tennis. So clearly she is exaggerating, even if slightly (I am sure she does work impossibly long hours by most people’s standards).\nWhen speaking about our work hours we have a strong cultural incentive to exaggerate. Indra Nui probably doesn’t want her shareholders thinking she slacks off. And young academics may often be concerned about looking good to their seniors, for all important reference letters.\nIf you really want to know how many hours you’re working I would recommend keeping a detailed log of your time and where you spend it."

Years and years ago I was doing field work on seals and we probably worked 12 hour days for 7 days straight (=84 hours), to keep up with all the seal counts and tagging we had to do. However, this was an exception and that work load only lasted a few weeks during the busy period of seal breeding.\nSo I think it is fair to say you might need to do long weeks sometimes (especially if you are a field biologist), but those hours needn’t be the norm."

So to compete with their peers, they need to work long hours.\nI think most people need training to become more efficient. If our mentors think working long-hours is neccessary, that suggests they could also improve their efficiency. So you should seek alternative advice. A good place to start for acadmeics is the iThinkwell webpage and books.\nI also found the book The 4 Hour Work Week helpful for thinking about how I could improve efficiency.\n(A few tips, cut out those low-value time-consuming projects or collaborations, put email low on your priority list of things to do and delegate wherever possible and, do the hardest and most important task first thing in the day).\nIn fact a Swedish study that shorter work hours actually increased the productivity of their workforce, because people were happier and healthier and took less sick days.\nTo improve your efficiency it can be helpful to log your activities at work. For instance, I learned that one of my pubs required about 100 hours of work to reach the point of submission. Looking at my data, I realised that a large portion of the time was spent following up on interesting, but not useful, ideas about complicated new analyses. As a result I have now changed my work practices to put greater emphasis on pre-planning of analyses, to stop myself from following multiple false leads.\nRemember too that there have been massive changes in technology since many of our mentors were trained. Technology can be a hinderance to productivity (email, social media!) but also a massive help (also email and social media!). You will need to do some experimentation to make technology work for your productivity."

If I think about an analysis on the ride home, is that work? or is it commuting? Or if we invite some scientist friends around for dinner and talk about science, is that work? What about watching nature documentaries with my son?\nIf you followed the tax office’s definition of work related activities, you could even classify some holidays as ‘work hours’. For instance, if I go on a diving holiday I am eligible for some tax deductions, because that counts as maintaining my work skills (I’m marine biologist).\nOr this webpage I maintain (its mostly a hobby I do outside of official work hours), should I count that towards work hours? Not everyone spends time maintaining their own webpage and blog rolls, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t successful in their careers.\nEvery one is different in how they work, so at the end of the day, it is not helpful to offer prescriptions about how many hours someone must work to be successful."

Not a programming language I know well.\nDoesn’t matter, because copilot knows Python and can follow my instructions. I could leverage the AI to help me build the game and it helped me learn how to write my own python code.\nIt was super fun to develop and I got my kids involved, who love having their own homemade game. They drew the game ‘art’ (texta drawings that I digitised) and recorded the sounds (me munching on lettuce to make a crunching urchin sound).\nPygame makes it easy to integrate the custom media into your game. And the AI meant we could go very quickly from a gaming idea to a working game.\nMy bigger agenda is to use video games as learning tools. They allow students to fail often and fail safely. Failing safely is one of the fastest ways to learn.\nSo I’ve wanted to develop my own games to teach ocean science for a while. But I’ve been put-off by the computer programming involved.

In fact, we should perhaps just get rid of ‘perspectives’ papers and make them blogs intead. Perspectives tend to present opinion rather than hard evidence. They suggest interesting ideas that need to be tested. Arguably putting them in our academic journals gives them the pretence of being evidence based science.

I will say you can integrate them with Slack, so that opens up some more convenient ways to use them and keep updated about changes.\nActually, on the topic of Dropbox, I have found it handy for working on collaborative analysis remotely with folk who aren’t that keen on learning Github. I can update the code that generates resulst and share it straight to dropbox, where they can view results."

There was recently a blog debate about their pros and cons, I think Scientist Sees Squirrel was involved, I can remember who else."

Observations are the foundation of predictive science, so how can we predict a future that is outside the envelope of the environments?\nThis is the question I will address in a new 2021 Australian Research Council Future Fellowship. Specifically, I will focus on predicting future change for coastal ecosystems.\nWatch a short video about the project\nHumanities footprint on the Earth’s ecosystem has never been greater. The oceans are increasingly being industrialized, and climate change means the footprint of human economic activity now touches even the most remote ecosystems.\nCoastal ecosystems exemplify the challenges we face in managing our growing impacts. Coasts are the thin line on which much of the human population and industrial activity rests. This human activity places great pressures on coastal ecosystems, and in many places, we are losing species and the ecological functions that support human livelihoods, like fisheries.\nPredicting the future for coastal ecosystems is critical for creating a sustainable relationship between humanity and nature. Ecological predictions allow us to identify options for better managing our relationship with ecosystems.\nReliable predictions are needed to help managers mitigate the risks of future human activities to the environment. In this four-year fellowship I will lead a team to develop new modelling techniques for predicting ecosystem change.\nI will show how we can define the limits of prediction by studying our ability to predict change in environments that have never been seen. These predictions will help us transition to a sustainable relationship with coastal ecosystems.\nIf you are interested in further study on this topic a couple of PhD positions have just opened up.

    "section": "Laura Griffiths notes on five key skills",
    "text": "Laura Griffiths notes on five key skills\n\n1. Technical Skills and Training\nThis relates specifically to your area of expertise. You need to communicate your knowledge and key concepts of your specific field. This will be highlighted in your CV but it’s possible that not all of your CV will be read. So the interview will provide an opportunity to emphasise your skills and training, as well as discuss other aspects not mentioned.\nA tip from this blog: Before going into the interview, make a list of the less obvious but equally important skills you’ve acquired over the years, whether through formal training or self-development. These could include proficiency in different software programmes, or internal training specific to your current or previous organisation.\n\n\n2. Communication skills\nThis is an important skill to show how you communicate verbally. Your CV and published papers will demonstrate your written communication skills, so the emphasis here is on verbal.\nInterviewers want to know how you express and articulate ideas succinctly and how you interact and connect to others, so use appropriate verbal language and use body language that suggests engagement. Your experience presenting at conferences, workshops, teaching, participating in ‘in house’ discussions (lab groups, etc) is a good way to show case these skills.\nIt is also useful to show how you are capable of tailoring your communication skills for different audiences – managers, peers, public, etc.\nA tip from Michael Page: Before an interview, practice talking about your experience out loud. Try to keep answers clear, concise and to the point. Good communication also requires you to be an excellent listener, so always pay close attention to exactly what’s being asked of you. Questions to prepare for are “Tell me about yourself” or “Tell me about your background”. See Link to Michael Page at bottom of article for more info.\n\n\n3. Problem Solving and Critical Thinking\nYou need to display an ability to take a logical and analytical approach to solving problems and resolving issues. It’s also good to show that you can approach problems from different angles.\nIt doesn’t just have to apply to technical problems but also social problems, etc. Critical thinking skills are an integral part of any post graduate study so this is a good way to showcase these skills and show how you have presented solutions back up by data and ideas to solve the problem.\n\n\n4. Professionalism and Leadership\nThis is all encompassing and includes how you can demonstrate professionalism, ie showing that you can prioritise, work efficiently and productively, and manage your time well.\nIt’s also good to be able to show employers how you decide what is important to focus on and get done, and how you go about meeting deadlines. It includes manners, having a positive attitude, being flexible, how you can motivate teams and other colleagues, etc.\nLeadership is about assigning and delegating tasks well, setting deadlines and leading by good example. Not all jobs are seeking leadership roles but having leadership as a skill can help you create opportunities.\nProfessionalism can be demonstrated by learning about the company/department you are being interviewed by. Show your enthusiasm and motivation to be part of their team.\nTip from Michael Page: In an interview discuss situations where you demonstrated these qualities with a positive effect. For example, if you do pride yourself on your people skills then you may want to talk about a time when you led a team, helped a colleague or were commended for your excellent service.\n\n\n5. Emotional Intelligence\nThis is an important skills across the board as developing and building relationships is crucial for any work environment.\nHere you need to demonstrate the following - how you develop relationships and network, how you interact with others, how you guide and monitor reactions of others, judge impacts, sensing contexts, etc. You could give an example of how you are sensitive to the needs of others – eg how you diffused heated discussion, how you played the role of a mediator, or simply how you interact in a team environment (listen and respond)."

    "title": "How do I interpret the AIC",
    "section": "",
    "text": "My student asked today how to interpret the AIC (Akaike’s Information Criteria) statistic for model selection. We ended up bashing out some R code to demonstrate how to calculate the AIC for a simple GLM (general linear model). I always think if you can understand the derivation of a statistic, it is much easier to remember how to use it.\nNow if you google derivation of the AIC, you are likely to run into a lot of math. But the principles are really not that complex. So here we will fit some simple GLMs, then derive a means to choose the ‘best’ one.\nSkip to the end if you just want to go over the basic principles.\nBefore we can understand the AIC though, we need to understand the statistical methodology of likelihoods.\n\n\nSay you have some data that are normally distributed with a mean of 5 and an sd of 3:\nset.seed(126)\nn &lt;- 50 #sample size\na &lt;- 5\nsdy &lt;- 3\ny &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = a, sd = sdy)\nhist(y)\n\nNow we want to estimate some parameters for the population that y was sampled from, like its mean and standard devaiation (which we know here to be 5 and 3, but in the real world you won’t know that).\nWe are going to use frequentist statistics to estimate those parameters. Philosophically this means we believe that there is ‘one true value’ for each parameter, and the data we observed are generated by this true value.\nm1 &lt;- glm(y ~ 1, family = \"gaussian\")\nsm1 &lt;- summary(m1)\nThe estimate of the mean is stored here coef(m1) =4.38, the estimated variance here sm1$dispersion= 5.91, or the SD sqrt(sm1$dispersion) =2.43. Just to be totally clear, we also specified that we believe the data follow a normal (AKA “Gaussian”) distribution.\nWe just fit a GLM asking R to estimate an intercept parameter (~1), which is simply the mean of y. We also get out an estimate of the SD (= \\(\\\\sqrt variance\\)) You might think its overkill to use a GLM to estimate the mean and SD, when we could just calculate them directly.\nWell notice now that R also estimated some other quantities, like the residual deviance and the AIC statistic.\nsummary(m1)\n\n##\n## Call:\n## glm(formula = y ~ 1, family = \"gaussian\")\n##\n## Deviance Residuals:\n##     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max\n## -5.7557  -0.9795   0.2853   1.7288   3.9583\n##\n## Coefficients:\n##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)\n## (Intercept)   4.3837     0.3438   12.75   &lt;2e-16 ***\n## ---\n## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n##\n## (Dispersion parameter for gaussian family taken to be 5.910122)\n##\n##     Null deviance: 289.6  on 49  degrees of freedom\n## Residual deviance: 289.6  on 49  degrees of freedom\n## AIC: 233.72\n##\n## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 2\nYou might also be aware that the deviance is a measure of model fit, much like the sums-of-squares. Note also that the value of the AIC is suspiciously close to the deviance. Despite its odd name, the concepts underlying the deviance are quite simple.\nAs I said above, we are observing data that are generated from a population with one true mean and one true SD. Given we know have estimates of these quantities that define a probability distribution, we could also estimate the likelihood of measuring a new value of y that say = 7.\nTo do this, we simply plug the estimated values into the equation for the normal distribution and ask for the relative likelihood of 7. We do this with the R function dnorm\nsdest &lt;- sqrt(sm1$dispersion)\ndnorm(7, mean = coef(m1), sd = sdest)\n\n## [1] 0.09196167\nFormally, this is the relative likelihood of the value 7 given the values of the mean and the SD that we estimated (=4.8 and 2.39 respectively if you are using the same random seed as me).\nYou might ask why the likelihood is greater than 1, surely, as it comes from a probability distribution, it should be &lt;1. Well, the normal distribution is continuous, which means it describes an infinte set of possible y values, so the probability of any given value will be zero. The relative likelihood on the other hand can be used to calculate the probability of a range of values.\nSo you might realise that calculating the likelihood of all the data would be a sensible way to measure how well our ‘model’ (just a mean and SD here) fits the data.\nHere’s what the likelihood looks like:\nplot(y, dnorm(y, mean = coef(m1), sd = sdest), ylab = \"Likelihood\")\n\nIt’s just a normal distribution.\nTo do this, think about how you would calculate the probability of multiple (independent) events. Say the chance I ride my bike to work on any given day is 3/5 and the chance it rains is 161/365 (like Vancouver!), then the chance I will ride in the rain[1] is 3/5 * 161/365 = about 1/4, so I best wear a coat if riding in Vancouver.\nWe can do the same for likelihoods, simply multiply the likelihood of each individual y value and we have the total likelihood. This will be a very small number, because we multiply a lot of small numbers by each other. So one trick we use is to sum the log of the likelihoods instead of multiplying them:\ny_lik &lt;- dnorm(y, mean = coef(m1), sd = sdest, log = TRUE)\nsum(y_lik)\n\n## [1] -114.8636\nThe larger (the less negative) the likelihood of our data given the model’s estimates, the ‘better’ the model fits the data. The deviance is calculated from the likelihood and for the deviance smaller values indicate a closer fit of the model to the data.\nThe parameter values that give us the smallest value of the -log-likelihood are termed the maximum likelihood estimates.\n\n\n\nNow say we have measurements and two covariates, x1 and x2, either of which we think might affect y:\na &lt;- 5\nb &lt;- 3\nn &lt;- 100\nx1 &lt;- rnorm(n)\nx2 &lt;- rnorm(n)\nsdy &lt;- 1\ny &lt;- a + b*x1 + rnorm(n, sd = sdy)\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(x1, y)\nplot(x2, y)\n\nSo x1 is a cause of y, but x2 does not affect y. How would we choose which hypothesis is most likely? Well one way would be to compare models with different combinations of covariates:\nm1 &lt;- glm(y ~ x1)\nm2 &lt;- glm(y ~ x2)\nm3 &lt;- glm(y ~ x1 + x2)\nNow we are fitting a line to y, so our estimate of the mean is now the line of best fit, it varies with the value of x1. To visualise this:\nplot(x1, y)\nlines(x1, predict(m1))\n\nThe predict(m1) gives the line of best fit, ie the mean value of y given each x1 value. We then use predict to get the likelihoods for each model:\nsm1 &lt;- summary(m1)\nsum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m1), sd = sqrt(sm1$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n\n## [1] -125.6214\n\nsm2 &lt;- summary(m2)\nsum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m2), sd = sqrt(sm2$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n\n## [1] -247.8059\n\nsm3 &lt;- summary(m3)\nsum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m3), sd = sqrt(sm3$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n\n## [1] -125.4843\nThe likelihood of m1 is larger than m2, which makes sense because m2 has the ‘fake’ covariate in it. The likelihood for m3 (which has both x1 and x2 in it) is fractionally larger than the likelihood m1, so should we judge that model as giving nearly as good a representation of the data?\nBecause the likelihood is only a tiny bit larger, the addition of x2 has only explained a tiny amount of the variance in the data. But where do you draw the line between including and excluding x2? You run into a similar problem if you use R^2 for model selection.\nSo what if we penalize the likelihood by the number of paramaters we have to estimate to fit the model? Then if we include more covariates (and we estimate more slope parameters) only those that account for a lot of the variation will overcome the penalty.\nWhat we want a statistic that helps us select the most parsimonious model.\n\n\n\nOne way we could penalize the likelihood by the number of parameters is to add an amount to it that is proportional to the number of parameters. First, let’s multiply the log-likelihood by -2, so that it is positive and smaller values indicate a closer fit.\nLLm1 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m1), sd = sqrt(sm1$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n-2*LLm1\n\n## [1] 251.2428\nWhy its -2 not -1, I can’t quite remember, but I think just historical reasons.\nThen add 2*k, where k is the number of estimated parameters.\n-2*LLm1 + 2*3\n\n## [1] 257.2428\nFor m1 there are three parameters, one intercept, one slope and one standard deviation. Now, let’s calculate the AIC for all three models:\n-2*LLm1 + 2*3\n\n## [1] 257.2428\n\nLLm2 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m2), sd = sqrt(sm2$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n-2*LLm2 + 2*3\n\n## [1] 501.6118\n\nLLm3 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m3), sd = sqrt(sm3$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n-2*LLm3 + 2*4\n\n## [1] 258.9686\nWe see that model 1 has the lowest AIC and therefore has the most parsimonious fit. Model 1 now outperforms model 3 which had a slightly higher likelihood, but because of the extra covariate has a higher penalty too.\nYou don’t need to do these calculations yourself everytime you want an AIC. The function AIC(m3) will just give it to you.\n\n\n\nSo to summarize, the basic principles that guide the use of the AIC are:\n\nLower indicates a more parsimonious model, relative to a model fit with a higher AIC.\nIt is a relative measure of model parsimony, so it only has meaning if we compare the AIC for alternate hypotheses (= different models of the data).\nWe can compare non-nested models. For instance, we could compare a linear to a non-linear model.\nThe comparisons are only valid for models that are fit to the same response data (ie values of y).\nModel selection conducted with the AIC will choose the same model as leave-one-out cross validation (where we leave out one data point and fit the model, then evaluate its fit to that point) for large sample sizes.\nYou shouldn’t compare too many models with the AIC. You will run into the same problems with multiple model comparison as you would with p-values, in that you might by chance find a model with the lowest AIC, that isn’t truly the most appropriate model.\nWhen using the AIC you might end up with multiple models that perform similarly to each other. So you have similar evidence weights for different alternate hypotheses. In the example above m3 is actually about as good as m1.\nYou should correct for small sample sizes if you use the AIC with small sample sizes, by using the AICc statistic.\nYou can access the AIC in R with the AIC() function.\n\nMessage me on Twitter if you have comments on this post.\n[1] Assuming it rains all day, which is reasonable for Vancouver."

Philosophically this means we believe that there is ‘one true value’ for each parameter, and the data we observed are generated by this true value.\nm1 &lt;- glm(y ~ 1, family = \"gaussian\")\nsm1 &lt;- summary(m1)\nThe estimate of the mean is stored here coef(m1) =4.38, the estimated variance here sm1$dispersion= 5.91, or the SD sqrt(sm1$dispersion) =2.43. Just to be totally clear, we also specified that we believe the data follow a normal (AKA “Gaussian”) distribution.\nWe just fit a GLM asking R to estimate an intercept parameter (~1), which is simply the mean of y. We also get out an estimate of the SD (= \\(\\\\sqrt variance\\)) You might think its overkill to use a GLM to estimate the mean and SD, when we could just calculate them directly.\nWell notice now that R also estimated some other quantities, like the residual deviance and the AIC statistic.\nsummary(m1)\n\n##\n## Call:\n## glm(formula = y ~ 1, family = \"gaussian\")\n##\n## Deviance Residuals:\n##     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max\n## -5.7557  -0.9795   0.2853   1.7288   3.9583\n##\n## Coefficients:\n##             Estimate Std.

Note also that the value of the AIC is suspiciously close to the deviance. Despite its odd name, the concepts underlying the deviance are quite simple.\nAs I said above, we are observing data that are generated from a population with one true mean and one true SD. Given we know have estimates of these quantities that define a probability distribution, we could also estimate the likelihood of measuring a new value of y that say = 7.\nTo do this, we simply plug the estimated values into the equation for the normal distribution and ask for the relative likelihood of 7. We do this with the R function dnorm\nsdest &lt;- sqrt(sm1$dispersion)\ndnorm(7, mean = coef(m1), sd = sdest)\n\n## [1] 0.09196167\nFormally, this is the relative likelihood of the value 7 given the values of the mean and the SD that we estimated (=4.8 and 2.39 respectively if you are using the same random seed as me).\nYou might ask why the likelihood is greater than 1, surely, as it comes from a probability distribution, it should be &lt;1. Well, the normal distribution is continuous, which means it describes an infinte set of possible y values, so the probability of any given value will be zero. The relative likelihood on the other hand can be used to calculate the probability of a range of values.\nSo you might realise that calculating the likelihood of all the data would be a sensible way to measure how well our ‘model’ (just a mean and SD here) fits the data.\nHere’s what the likelihood looks like:\nplot(y, dnorm(y, mean = coef(m1), sd = sdest), ylab = \"Likelihood\")\n\nIt’s just a normal distribution.\nTo do this, think about how you would calculate the probability of multiple (independent) events. Say the chance I ride my bike to work on any given day is 3/5 and the chance it rains is 161/365 (like Vancouver!), then the chance I will ride in the rain[1] is 3/5 * 161/365 = about 1/4, so I best wear a coat if riding in Vancouver.\nWe can do the same for likelihoods, simply multiply the likelihood of each individual y value and we have the total likelihood. This will be a very small number, because we multiply a lot of small numbers by each other. So one trick we use is to sum the log of the likelihoods instead of multiplying them:\ny_lik &lt;- dnorm(y, mean = coef(m1), sd = sdest, log = TRUE)\nsum(y_lik)\n\n## [1] -114.8636\nThe larger (the less negative) the likelihood of our data given the model’s estimates, the ‘better’ the model fits the data. The deviance is calculated from the likelihood and for the deviance smaller values indicate a closer fit of the model to the data.\nThe parameter values that give us the smallest value of the -log-likelihood are termed the maximum likelihood estimates."

How would we choose which hypothesis is most likely? Well one way would be to compare models with different combinations of covariates:\nm1 &lt;- glm(y ~ x1)\nm2 &lt;- glm(y ~ x2)\nm3 &lt;- glm(y ~ x1 + x2)\nNow we are fitting a line to y, so our estimate of the mean is now the line of best fit, it varies with the value of x1. To visualise this:\nplot(x1, y)\nlines(x1, predict(m1))\n\nThe predict(m1) gives the line of best fit, ie the mean value of y given each x1 value. We then use predict to get the likelihoods for each model:\nsm1 &lt;- summary(m1)\nsum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m1), sd = sqrt(sm1$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n\n## [1] -125.6214\n\nsm2 &lt;- summary(m2)\nsum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m2), sd = sqrt(sm2$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n\n## [1] -247.8059\n\nsm3 &lt;- summary(m3)\nsum(dnorm(y, mean = predict(m3), sd = sqrt(sm3$dispersion), log = TRUE))\n\n## [1] -125.4843\nThe likelihood of m1 is larger than m2, which makes sense because m2 has the ‘fake’ covariate in it. The likelihood for m3 (which has both x1 and x2 in it) is fractionally larger than the likelihood m1, so should we judge that model as giving nearly as good a representation of the data?\nBecause the likelihood is only a tiny bit larger, the addition of x2 has only explained a tiny amount of the variance in the data. But where do you draw the line between including and excluding x2? You run into a similar problem if you use R^2 for model selection.\nSo what if we penalize the likelihood by the number of paramaters we have to estimate to fit the model? Then if we include more covariates (and we estimate more slope parameters) only those that account for a lot of the variation will overcome the penalty.\nWhat we want a statistic that helps us select the most parsimonious model."

    "text": "One way we could penalize the likelihood by the number of parameters is to add an amount to it that is proportional to the number of parameters.

Model 1 now outperforms model 3 which had a slightly higher likelihood, but because of the extra covariate has a higher penalty too.\nYou don’t need to do these calculations yourself everytime you want an AIC. The function AIC(m3) will just give it to you."

    "text": "So to summarize, the basic principles that guide the use of the AIC are:\n\nLower indicates a more parsimonious model, relative to a model fit with a higher AIC.\nIt is a relative measure of model parsimony, so it only has meaning if we compare the AIC for alternate hypotheses (= different models of the data).\nWe can compare non-nested models. For instance, we could compare a linear to a non-linear model.\nThe comparisons are only valid for models that are fit to the same response data (ie values of y).\nModel selection conducted with the AIC will choose the same model as leave-one-out cross validation (where we leave out one data point and fit the model, then evaluate its fit to that point) for large sample sizes.\nYou shouldn’t compare too many models with the AIC. You will run into the same problems with multiple model comparison as you would with p-values, in that you might by chance find a model with the lowest AIC, that isn’t truly the most appropriate model.\nWhen using the AIC you might end up with multiple models that perform similarly to each other. So you have similar evidence weights for different alternate hypotheses. In the example above m3 is actually about as good as m1.\nYou should correct for small sample sizes if you use the AIC with small sample sizes, by using the AICc statistic.\nYou can access the AIC in R with the AIC() function.\n\nMessage me on Twitter if you have comments on this post.\n[1] Assuming it rains all day, which is reasonable for Vancouver."

We can pick out points that are greater than 2SDs from the trend:\nmodresid &lt;- resid(mod1)\nsd2 &lt;- sd(modresid)*2\nipt &lt;- which(abs(modresid) &gt; sd2)\n\nplot(x,y, pch = 16, col = grey(0.5,0.5), las = 1)\nabline(mod1, lwd = 2, col = 'red')\npoints(x[ipt], y[ipt], pch = 16, col = rgb(1,0,0, 0.6))\n\n\n\nThe problem with bar charts\nHere is an interesting blog on the problem with barcharts.\nFirst, let’s generate some data to play with, it has three variables x, y and z.\nn &lt;- 40\nx &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = 20, sd = 8)\ny &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = 20, sd = 3)\nz &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = 10, sd = 8)\n\ndat &lt;- data.frame(grp = c(rep(\"x\", n), rep(\"y\", n), rep(\"z\", n)),\n                          val = c(x,y,z))\nNow compare these three charts, the first is just the means:\nsdat &lt;- dat %&gt;% group_by(grp) %&gt;%\n  summarize(val = mean(val))\n\nplot(1:3, sdat$val, type = 'p', xaxt = \"n\", xlab = '', ylab = '',\n     las = 1, cex.axis = 1.5, pch = 16, cex = 2)\naxis(1, at = 1:3, labels = sdat$grp, cex.axis = 1.5)\nThe second has standard errors and so captures some of the variation in our data :\nggplot(dat, aes(x = grp, y = val)) +\n  stat_summary(fun.data = \"mean_se\", size = 1.3) +\n  xlab(\"Group\") +\n  ylab(\"Values\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=16),\n       axis.title=element_text(size=18))\n\nThe third has boxplots, so is perhaps the most truthful, because it shows quantiles and the full range of the data (which is much broader than just the SEs).\nggplot(dat, aes(x = grp, y = val)) +\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"black\") +\n  xlab(\"Group\") +\n  ylab(\"Values\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=16),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=18))\n\n\n\nDon’t waste digital ink\nPlots with less ‘add-ons’ tend to communicate the key message more clearly. For instance, just like excel plots dont:\nx &lt;- rnorm(100)\ndat &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = 0.25*x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.2))\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_excel() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\nYou can get additional themes for ggplot2 using this excellent package.\nA cleaner view:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_base() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\nOr simply:\nplot(dat$x, dat$y, xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"y\", las = 1)\n\nA good principle is to not use ‘ink’ on figures that isn’t needed to communicate your message. Tufte takes the ‘less ink’ philosophy to the extreme:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_tufte() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\n\n\nWhen is ggplot2 appropriate, or when should I use base R?\nIn general I think ggplot2 is appropriate for problems of intermediate complexity. Like this:\n Base R is great if you just want to plot a barplot quickly, or do an x-y plot. ggplot2 comes into its own for slight more complex plots, like having multiple panels for different groups or colouring lines by a 3rd factor. But once you move to really complex plots, like overlaying a subplot on a map, ggplot2 becomes very difficult, if not impossible. At that point it is better to move back to Base R. ggplot2 can also get very fiddly if you are very specific about your plots, like having certain colours, or the labels in a certain way.\nAs an example, ggplot2 is great for data like this:\nx1 &lt;- rnorm(30)\ngrps &lt;- letters[c(rep(1, 10), rep(2, 10), rep(3, 10))]\ny1 &lt;- x1 + c(rep(1, 10), rep(-1, 10), rep(2, 10)) + rnorm(30)\ndat &lt;- data.frame(x = x1, grps = grps, y = y1)\nhead(dat)\n\n##            x grps         y\n## 1  0.3293278    a 1.5458494\n## 2 -0.2975122    a 0.5877379\n## 3  1.1849880    a 2.2053261\n## 4  1.3095354    a 3.2023256\n## 5 -1.1704553    a 1.2776289\n## 6  0.9961189    a 1.7440880\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x1, y = y1, color = grps)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw()\n\nIt is also pretty handy for faceting:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() + facet_grid(.~grps)+\n  theme_bw()\n\nThe key with ggplot2 is to have your data in a data-frame.\nIn reality both ggplot2 and base R graphics are worth learning, but I would start with learning the basics of base R graphics and then move onto ggplot2 if you want to quickly plot lots of structured data-sets.\n\n\nPie graphs vs bar graphs\nIn Mariani et al. they plot rates of seafood fraud by several European countries. While its a foundational study that establishes improvement in the accuracy of food labelling, their graphics could be improved in several ways.\nFirst they use perspective pies. This makes it incredibly hard to compare the two groups (fish that are labelled/mislabelled). Humans are very bad at comparing angles and pretty bad at comparing areas. With the perspective you can’t even compare the areas properly. They do provide the raw numbers, but then, why bother with the pies?\nNote that the % pies misrepresent the data slightly because the % figures are actually odds ratios (mis-labels / correct labels), rather than percent (mis-labeels / total samples).\nSecond the pies are coloured red/green, which will be hard for red-green colourblind people to see.\nThird, they have coloured land blue on their map, so it appears to be ocean at first look.\nFourth, the map is not really neccessary. There are no spatial patterns going on that the authors want to draw attention to. I guess having a map does emphasize that the study is in Europe. Finally, the size of each pie is scaled to the sample size, but the scale bar for the sample size shows a sample of only 30, whereas most of their data are for much larger samples sizes (&gt;200). Do you get the impression from the pies that the UK has 668 samples, whereas Ireland only has 187? Therefore, from this graphic we have no idea what sample size was used in each country.\nIn fact, all the numbers that are difficult to interpret in the figure are very nicely presented in Table 1.\nBelow is a start at improving the presentation. For instance, you could do a simple bar chart, ordering by rate of mislabelling.\ncnames &lt;- c('Ireland' ,'UK','Germany','France','Spain','Portugal')\ncorrlab &lt;- c(180, 647, 145, 146, 267, 178)\nmislab &lt;- c(7, 21, 9, 4, 24, 12)\nmisrate &lt;- 100*signif(mislab / (corrlab + mislab),2)                  \ncorrrate &lt;- 100 - misrate\nord &lt;- order(misrate, decreasing = T)\ny &lt;- rbind(corrrate, misrate)\n\npar(mar = c(5,4,4,7))\nbarplot(y[,ord], names.arg = cnames[ord], col = c('skyblue','tomato'), ylab = 'Labelling rate (%)', las = 2)\nlegend(x=7.5, y = 90, legend = c(\"Mislabelled\", \"Correctly labelled\"), pch = 16, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), xpd = NA, cex = 0.7)\n\nYou could add another subfigure to this, showing the rate by different species too.\nThe barplot doesn’t communicate the sample size, but then that is probably not the main point. The sample sizes are probably best reported in the table\nIf we felt the map was essential, then putting barcharts on it would be more informative. It is not that easy to add barcharts ontop of an existing map in R, so I would recommend creating the barcharts seperately, then adding them on in Illustrator or Powerpoint.\nWe can make a basic map like this:\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(maptools)\nmap('world', xlim = c(-20, 20), ylim = c(35, 60), col = 'grey', fill = T)\n\nThen create some nice barcharts. We write a loop so we get one barchart for each country.\nnc &lt;- length(cnames)\npar(mfrow = c(2,3), oma = c(1,1,1,3))\nfor (i in 1:nc){\n  y &lt;- c(mislab[i], corrlab[i])\n  barplot(y, names.arg = '', las = 2, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), ylim = c(0, corrlab[i]), main = cnames[i], cex.main = 2.4, yaxt = 'n')\n  byy &lt;- signif(max(y),2)/3\n  yat &lt;- c(0, min(y), max(y))\naxis(2, at = yat, las = 2, cex.axis = 2, labels = F)  \naxis(2, at = yat[2:3], las = 2, cex.axis = 2, labels = T)  \n}\nlegend(x = 2.8, y = 500, legend = c('Fraud', 'Correct'), pch = 15, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), xpd = NA, cex = 2, bty = 'n')\n\n\n\nScaling matters\nIt can be misleading to present % and proportion data on axes that are not scaled 0 - 100%. For instance, compare these three graphs:\ny &lt;- c(70, 72, 68, 73)\nx &lt;- 1:4\nxnams &lt;- LETTERS[1:4]\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,3), oma = c(1,1,1,3), mar = c(5,6,2,2))\nplot(x,y, pch = 3, cex = 2, las = 1, xaxt  = 'n', xlab = '', ylab = 'Percent', cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, tcl = 0.5, xlim = c(0, 5), col = 'red', lwd = 3)\naxis(1, at = x, labels = xnams, cex.axis = 2, tcl = 0.5)\n\nbarplot(y, names.arg = xnams, las = 1, cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.names = 2, ylab = 'Percent')\n\nbarplot(y, names.arg = xnams, las = 1, cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.names = 2, ylab = 'Percent', ylim = c(0, 100))"

Luckily there is a package to help you make the right decision for a colour scale, it is called RColorBrewer. Check out colorbrewer.org for a helpful interactive web interface for choosing colours.\nFirst let’s load some sea surface temperature data as a raster:\nlibrary(raster)\nr &lt;- raster(\"MeanAVHRRSST\")\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(r, col = rev(brewer.pal(11, \"Spectral\")), asp = NA)\nplot(r, col = brewer.pal(11, \"Purples\"), asp = NA)\n\n## Warning in brewer.pal(11, \"Purples\"): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Purples is 9\n## Returning the palette you asked for with that many colors\n\nUsing red-green palettes makes it hard for colour blind people. Also, using a diverging palette makes it look like there is something important about the middle point (yellow). A better palette to use would be one of the sequential ones, “Purples” shown here.\nTo make it easier to understand, let’s look at these again as contour plots. I will use a more appropriate diverging palette to the red-green one though.\nz &lt;- matrix(rep(1:10, 10), nrow = 10)\nfilled.contour(z, col = brewer.pal(9, 'Reds'), nlevels = 10)\n\nfilled.contour(z, col = brewer.pal(9, 'RdBu'), nlevels = 10)\n\nNotice the diverging pallette creates an artificial split at yellow\nOne of the only legitimate uses for pie graphs (I think) is visualising the colour scales.

    "text": "The increasing pace of climate change and human impacts on ecosystems is pushing ecosystems beyond the envelope of past conditions. The pace of change makes predicting that change much harder. In a new study, Assessing predictive accuracy of species abundance models in dynamic systems, we show how to test model forecasts in rapidly changing ecosystems.\nGood tests of model forecasts help us quantify uncertainty and are important for many management applications including fisheries stock forecasts, species extinction risk and climate-smart conservation planning.\nThe pace of change is a problem for making predictions because our models are trained on historical data. Model’s predict best when they are predicting to conditions they’ve ‘seen’ in the training data. Unprecedented environmental change means our models need to extrapolate. This is much harder.\nOne recent example is the deadly algal bloom across 500km of South Australia’s coast. No ones saw this coming. No-one yet knows if its likely to reoccur or not.\nWe developed a way to test models with historical data to get an idea of how well they extrapolate. This gives us a better measurement of model uncertainty that we can use to calibrate risk, e.g. to see how much we might be under-estimating extinction risk or overestimating fish stock size.\nWe illustrated our method with a 30 year timeseries of reef biota from Maria Island. We split this time-series into sections used for training and sections used for testing the model. The model is then fit to the training data and forecast to the testing data. The difference between its forecast and the test data is a measure of its errors.\nOur new method forces the model to fit to ‘out-of-date’ data. Whereas, the typical method keeps the models contemporary to the testing data. g We confirmed that for a species with a population collapse our new method gives a much more pessimistic (broader) estimate of uncertainty than the typical method would do.\nWe suggest our method be used to better estimate risk measures when using models to forecast ecological change. Our method can also be used in meta-studies that are exploring how predictability varies across different species, places and times. This is a point we’ll pick up in our next study. Read more here."

I received peer reviews on a paper I had submitted to a journal.\n(The positive one thought the paper was well written, the negative one thought it was poorly written. This seems to be a common problem for me, if anyone has any insights on why, I’d love to hear. Maybe its just that some people don’t like the writing style of an Australian who went to school in the 90s, whereas others don’t mind that style?)\nThe negative review left a bad taste and I wasted my ride home that day thinking about it.

    "text": "Thinking differently\nIt is easy to tell someone to think differently, but quite hard to do. We have to train our minds to think differently.\n\nBeing more aware to think less about it negative thoughts\nOne way is to try to think less about the negative criticism. But in trying not to think about something we tend to think about it even more.\nSo the trick (from meditation practice) is to be self-aware of what you are thinking. Every time you think the negative thought, acknowledge it and then let it go. Keep doing this over and over, eventually you will stop thinking the negative thought.\nIt can help to have a visualization to go along with this process of acknowledging and letting go. A classic is thinking of the thoughts as leaves floating down a stream. You see them, acknowledge them, then let them float on by.\n(I’m a marine biologist, so I imagine I’m scuba diving in blue water. Ctenophores are the thoughts drifting by, I watch them, then let them drift away.)\n\n\nImpersonalize it\nThe next trick is to try and make the criticism impersonal. The person may have legitimately been trying to help improve your work, only they didn’t know how to deliver the advice in a more constructive way (or sometimes they didn’t put much care into phrasing their criticism).\nI’m not saying to try and suppress any emotion you feel about the criticism. Certainly acknowledge your feelings. But then try to reword the criticism in a more constructive way.\nI often ask myself on reading paper reviews “what is the real problem here”? For instance a review may criticize your paper for having insufficient data. Perhaps the real problem is that you’ve overstated the findings of the paper, relative to the data at hand. So scaling back your discussion of the study’s implications may be the more direct solution to this issue.\nNow I’ve turned the criticism into a solution, and I feel better.\n\n\nWhy do you care anyway?\nIf negative criticism gets you down, you might go into a negative thought spiral. As an (extreme!) example: A reviewer criticizes your study’s analysis. You start to think you’re useless at analysis, and therefore a useless scientist (maybe its imposter syndrome too?). You’ve wasted years of study and your whole life on this career choice.\nBut, we can turn this negative spiral around and make it positive.\nTo do that, ask yourself the same question about why you care three times. This helps get to the root cause.\nAs an example: A reviewer criticizes my study’s analysis. Why do I care? Well I want to get the paper published. Why do I want to get the paper published? Because I put so much work into it. Why do I care that I put so much work into it? Well I want validation that my career choice and all the time I devote to it is worthwhile.\nThis process then helps me see that there are other things I value in my career, beyond publishing papers. Like seeing my students succeed, or seeing my science helping conserve nature.\nSo criticism of an analysis is a set-back, but only a small one in the scheme of things."

Write it once, then put yourself in the receivers shoes and read it again.\nThink about the consequences of their work too and make sure the criticism is in proportion to the consequences. We’re all guilty of getting a bit too ‘excited’ about being critical when we spot a mistake. Was a student’s writing sloppy in it’s preparation? Well tell them, but you don’t need to go to town on it, after all, it’s only some bad writing and not a flaw in a crucial life-support device.\nScience does progress by criticism and academic culture needs that. But the progress will happen more effectively if we’re kind to people when we serve them a dish of critical thought."

    "title": "Choosing R packages for mixed effects modelling based on the car you drive",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are many roads you can take to fit a mixed effects model (sometimes termed hierarchical models) in R. There are numerous packages that each deploy different engines to fit mixed effects models.\nIn this driveability review, I look at some of the dominant packages for mixed effects models The focus of this review is on the practicality of each package, rather than their numerical accuracy. Information on numerical accuracy can be found in the academic literature, see the bibliography below. I will lookat each package’s handling, speed and adaptability for tackling different types of questions.\nSummary of the packages strengths and weaknesses. Speeds are relative to lme4 in a test case problem, see below for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nlme4\n\n\nrjags\n\n\nINLA\n\n\nRStan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative speed\n\n\n1\n\n\n100\n\n\n10\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nHandling- ease of coding1\n\n\nStraightforward\n\n\nHard\n\n\nModerate\n\n\nHard\n\n\n\n\nUser manual\n\n\nAccessible\n\n\nBrief and technical\n\n\nVery technical2\n\n\nHighly accessible\n\n\n\n\nOnline documentation\n\n\nExtensive\n\n\nExtensive\n\n\nNascent\n\n\nNascent\n\n\n\n\nSupport from developers3\n\n\nGood\n\n\nGood\n\n\nOutstanding\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n\nTesting for accuracy\n\n\nExtensive\n\n\nExtensive for some types of models\n\n\nNascent\n\n\nNascent\n\n\n\n\nAdaptability - types of models you can fit\n\n\nLimited\n\n\nYour imagination is the limit\n\n\nExtensive\n\n\nAlmost as much as JAGS\n\n\n\n\nBest for\n\n\nSimple problems, quick implementation\n\n\nCustomising complex models\n\n\nSpatio-temporal models\n\n\nDeveloping new types of models\n\n\n\n\nHow you will look driving it\n\n\nTraditional, but elegant\n\n\nYou like to take the scenic route\n\n\nEdgy and slightly mysterious\n\n\nHanging with the cool kids\n\n\n\n\n\nbut see below for some add-on packages which make life easier for STAN and JAGS\n= lots of equations\nIn my experience. But, heck these packages are all free and all give better user support than many paid services!\n\nThe first is lme4, meaning linear mixed effects models with S4 classes. lme4 is like an older model sports-car - fast, respectable, well known and able to handle common types of questions. lme4 uses maximum likelihood methods for estimation, so interpret its statistics as a frequentist.\nThe next three packages are Bayesian techniques.\nThe second package is rjags, which is an interface to the “Just Another Gibbs Sampler” program. rjags is the Land-Rover of packages for mixed effects models: well tested, able to tackle just about any terrian, but slow and prone to breaking down (usually a user error, rather than the package itself).\n\n\n\nMy take on reviewing R packages for Generalised Linear Mixed Effects. Clockwise from top left: The lme4 package is fast but a bit older, like an early noughties Ferrari; the JAGS program goes anywhere like a Range Rover, but breaks often and is slow; the Stan language is modern and efficient like a hybrid BMW and INLA is fast and modern but requires technical expertise like a Tesla.\n\n\nThe third package is INLA, standing for “Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation”. INLA is like an electric sports car: it is a modern technique that is lightning fast, but there has been limited testing to date and you better understand what is under the hood before you attempt to drive it.\nThe final package is RStan, which is the R interface to the Stan modelling language. RStan is like like BMW’s hybrid, combining computational speed with flexibility and with exceptional documentation and support.\nNow, let’s look at each packages computational speed, handling (ease of use), driver support (documentation, existing knowledge and forums) and flexibility.\nSkip to the end for a biblography of examples and some cool packages that build on these tools.\n\n\nThe frequentist and Bayesian approaches I review here come from fundamentally different statistical philosophies. Here I will tackle the approaches pragmatically, looking at estimation speed and so on, however you might exclude one or the other a-prior based on your bent towards Bayesian or frequentist thinking.\n\n\n\nI simulated a simple hierarchical data-set to test each of the models. The script is available here. The data-set has 100 binary measurements. There is one fixed covariate (continuous ) and one random effect with five groups. The linear predictor was transformed to binomial probabilities using the logit function. For the Bayesian approaches, slightly different priors were used for each package, depending on what was available. See the script for more details on priors.\nFor each package I fit the same linear model with binomial errors and a logit link. To fit the models I used the functions glmer() from lme4, inla() from INLA, custom code for rjags and the stan_glmer() from the package rstanarm to fit the Stan model (you can also write your own custom code for RStan, but for convenience I used the canned version of mixed effects models).\nComputational speeds for fitting a binomial Generalised Linear Model to 100 samples with one random and one fixed effect. Relative times are relative to lme4\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement\n\n\nlme4\n\n\nrjags\n\n\nINLA\n\n\nRStan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed (Seconds)\n\n\n0.063\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n0.59\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n\n\nSpeed (relative)\n\n\n1\n\n\n99\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nSo lme4 is by far the fastest, clocking in at around 6 tenths of a second (on my 3GHz Intel i7 Macbook Pro). INLA comes in second, ten times slower than lme4, then followed an order of magnitude later by RStan and finally rjags came plodding along behind about 100 times slower than lme4.\nIf you run the code I have provided you will see that all packages come up with similar estimates for the model parameters.\n\n\n\nlme4 leads the pack when it comes to ease of use. If you have your data sorted, then you can go from zero to fitted model in one line of code. INLA is similar, however you should generally not rely on default priors but specify your own, which requires additional code and thinking.\nUse of RStan and rjags depends on how you use them. You can write your own model code, which can lead to quite lengthy scripts, but also gives you greater number of choices for how you design your model. However, there are also many packages that provide wrapper’s to RStan and rjags that will fit common types of models (like mixed effects models). These tend to be as simple as INLA’s functions, remembering that you should think carefully about prior choice.\nIf you are going to write your own models, you will need to get good at debugging, so there is an extra overhead there.\nModel checking is another important consideration.\nFor users familiar with GLMs, lme4 probably provides the most familiar support for model checking. INLA can be more difficult to use, because it requires the user to hand-code many model checking routines. INLA, rjags and RStan also require the user to carefully check that the fitting algorithms have performed properly.\nEach of these packages use different types of algorithms, so the statistics you will use to check algorithm performance are different. See each package’s documentation for further advice.\n\n\n\nlme4 and RStan have the highest quality user-manuals. Both are well written and provide numerous examples that users will find helpful.\nThe user manual for rjags and JAGS is somewhat brief, but the user can easily find many helpful examples on the web, and these packages are covered by numerous books. So if you are willing to broaden your search you should have no trouble finding help.\nRStan and INLA are both relatively new, so fewer examples can be found on the web. While RStan has an excellent manual for both the mathsy and non-mathsy types, documentation of INLA can be difficult to follow for novice users, because much of it is equations.\nWeb support and chat groups are also an important aspect of model development. Help for all packages can be found on sites like Stackoverflow, or you can post your own new questions there.\nPersonally, I have found that support for INLA, through their forum, is exceptional. On several occaisons I have posted questions for which I could not find documentation and have generally recieved a response from INLA’s developers before the end of the working day. This is amazing, because it is better than you would expect from many paid services.\nI have not participated in forums for the other packages, so I can’t add comments here.\nOne final note on support is that lme4 and JAGS are both pretty well studied approaches to modelling and there are numerous academic papers dealing with their biases and accuracy. INLA and RStan are relatively new on the scene, so for new and different types of problems you might want to run your own simulation study to check that your model is performing as expected.\n\n\n\nYour imagination is the limit with rjags - take it on well driven routes, like a mixed effects model, or off-road on new adventures with Bayesian structural equation modelling - it can do it all.\nrjags is followed closely by RStan. RStan has a few limitations, but can basically do anything JAGS can do, and often faster (e.g. this ecological study). RStan will probably eventually replace rjags, but to date rjags persists because of the extensive range of well documented examples users can build on.\nINLA comes in fourth with a diverse range of built in likelihoods and model functions (you can even ask the developers to add more and they might do it!). INLA is becoming particularly popular for modelling spatial and temporal auto-correlation, partly due to its speed. You can do these types of models with RStan and rjags but computations might be impossibly slow.\nlme4 is the least flexible of packages - though there are some options to customise it’s models. The similar nlme package also provides a range of tools for fitting random effects for spatial and temporal autocorrelation.\nThere are however, some clever tricks you can do with lme4 to fit a broader range of models. For instance, you can include a random effect where every sample is a separate group in a Poisson GLM to get a Poisson with extra variation.\n\n\n\nThat’s all. I hope this blog helps you make a good choice before investing in learning a new tool for mixed effects models.

    "text": "Inspiration for a model of reserve enforcement\n\nThe story of how this paper came to be is slightly unusual and I think, worth telling. It starts, like many good things, in the 1980s.\n\nSome time ago Hugh Possingham (Director of Science at The Nature Conservancy) was describing his PhD work on optimal foraging of nectar eating birds.\nBack in the 80s he had developed some models of how a bird would draw down on nectar in a flower. The flower then recharges itself until the bird next visits and draws off nectar again. He wanted to know the optimal timing for the bird to wait before it returned to the flower.\nMore recently, Hugh had suggested we use this model to predict outcomes for coral reefs under successive cyclones. Corals presumably grow steadily until a cyclone, which knocks them back down again. So what you get is something like in the below graph.\n\nLike all handy models, I stored it away in the back of my head, in case I had reason to use it.\nYears later Eddie Game, also of The Nature Conservancy, suggested I look into analysing some data TNC had collected on its reserves in Raja Ampat.\nRaja Ampat is the global centre of fish and coral diversity and also the site of a large multi-institutional network of protected areas (that also involved WWF among others)."

You might also want to invest in educating people about where the reserves are and their benefits.\nAs a young diver I had been struck by how my local reserves (in Tasmania) could go from being stacked full of lobster to practically empty overnight. It only took one serious poacher to go out and catch a large number of naive lobster.\nSo when Eddie asked about modelling the Raja Ampat situation I thought back to Hugh’s model of intermittent knock-backs."

    "text": "Intermittent poaching\nAnd what we ended up doing was modelling poaching as intermittent events that knock back fish abundance (like the bird sucking up nectar), which then recovers slowly in between poaching events.\nBut we redesigned the model so it was appropriate for fish.\nIn Indonesia you have fishing boats dubbed ‘roving bandits’ (Here’s a pdf of the original paper). These are large (often international) boats that roam around depleting local reefs of fish before they move to the next location. Unlike local fishers they have no incentive to invest in locally sustainable fishing.\nSo it made sense to model these roving bandits as intermittent poachers that removed a large biomass of fish.\nWhat the model showed was that you need to ensure poaching by roving bandits is very infrequent to allow fish biomass adequate time to recover to above baseline levels. If poaching was too frequent the reserve would never get anywhere, it was effectively a ‘paper park’.\nOne problem had me stuck however. I had to specify a parameter to relate the rate of enforcement to the rate of poaching. But I had no idea how to measure or interpret this parameter. Enter an international collaboration."

I also recruited local PhD student Brett Parker to help with data analysis.\nIt was great to get to collaborate with this international team and combine our analytical know-how with local expertise on the problems at hand.\nAn important insight that emerged from this collaboration was the value of local community support. Then it struck me how to interpret the missing parameter - it reflects how much communities support reserves.\nIf a community doesn’t support a reserve they are more likely to poach, often despite of enforcement effort. Whereas, if the support the reserve they may never poach and even help by reporting on foreign poachers. This insight provided a way to interpret the new parameter I had introduced in turning the bird model into a fish model.\nSo we used the model to estimate the benefit of community support to improving fish biomass in the reserve. When local communities support reserves they are less likely to poach themselves and may contribute to surveillance by reporting on illegal poachers.\nThe benefit of community support could also be measured in terms of savings a management agency might make on its budget for enforcement.\nSo if you get a chance to read the article, take a moment to notice the reference to nectar feeding birds, and the mix of modelling and local insight.\nThe cost of enforcing a marine protected area to achieve ecological targets for the recovery of fish biomass was published online at Biological Conservation, November 2018\nIf you can’t access that journal here’s an open access pre-print) or email me for a copy."

    "title": "Quantifying the magnitude of a population decline with Bayesian time-series modelling",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Population abundances tend to vary year to year. This variation can make it make it hard detect a change and hard to quantify exactly what that change is.\nBayesian time-series analysis can help us quantify a decline and put uncertainty bounds on it too. Here I will use the R-INLA package to fit a time-series model to a population decline.\n\nFor instance, take the pictured time-series. Quantifying change as the difference between the first and last time-points is obviously misleading. Doing so would imply that abundance has declined by 77% from the historical value.\nAnother approach would be to compare the average of the first and last decades. Doing so would yield a 72% decline.\nA better way might be to model the population trend over time and then estimate our change from the model. An advantage of a model is we can be more specific (and transparent) about assumptions. Using Bayesian time-series analysis we can also pick a model that is appropriate for the distribution of the data. e.g. here I will use negative binomial errors, because the abundances are counts.\n\nSimulating a time-series\nLet’s simulate a simple time-series of counts that declines at a constant (exponential) rate:\nset.seed(1969)\nn  &lt;-  50\nrho  &lt;-  0.8\nprec  &lt;-  10\ninit &lt;- 7\nacoef &lt;- c(rep(-0.01, n/2), rep(-0.03, n/2))\neta &lt;- init + (acoef*(1:n))\ny &lt;- rnbinom(n, mu  =  exp(eta), size  =  5)\ndata  &lt;-  list(y =y, z = 1:n)\nThe results are pictured above. In short we calculate eta which is the linear predictor. Its exponent determines the mean of the negative binomial process, hence the exponential (not linear) decline. The size = 5 means that the count data will be moderately over-dispersed - that is quite noisy (the variance will be &gt; than the mean).\nNotice that I put a bit of a ‘kink’ in eta by having the rate of decline (acoef), increase halfway through the time-series like this:\n\nWe can calculate the magnitude of change like this: 1 - (y[n]/y[1]) = 0.77 which can be interpreted as what fraction of the intial years biomass has been lost?\nWhat we want to do is put a smoother over time, so our estimate accounts for short-term variation. We also want to get credibility intervals (95% probability intervals) on the estimate of decline.\n\n\nFitting a time-series model with INLA\nR-INLA is a pretty handy package. It is a very fast way to fit generalized linear models and can also handle a huge range of different types of random effects. Here we will use an auto-regressive lag one process. That is saying that abundance at time t depends on abundance at time t-1 with some constant correlation coefficient.\nWe could also include other covariates in the model, for instance, abundance of a predator that might eat our organism of interest. However, we won’t go into that here.\nFirst up, we specify the formula in INLA’s notation:\nlibrary(INLA)\nf1 &lt;- y ~ 1 + f(z, model = \"ar1\")\nWhich just says model y as a function of an intercept term (constant mean) + an autoregressive process that depends on z (just an index for the year). The f() is INLA’s standard notation for modelling its different random effects models (AKA latent models), here we chose the ar1 option.\nNow the trick is to get INLA to compute the % difference between the expectation for the first and last time points as it goes. That way we not only get an estimate of the change but also we will get the full posterior distribution, so we can get our CIs. Note I put emphasis on expectation, because we won’t simply be calculating the difference between the first and last points (we did that above), but will in fact be calculating the difference between the model’s estimated mean values for the first and last points.\nTo do that we use INLA’s linear combination feature.\nThis feature let’s us compute a linear combination of the estimated covariates. Here we will ask for the difference between the first and last values of z (the time-series). inla will multiply the z values by the numbers we give below (here -1 and 1), then sum them together.\nlc1 &lt;- inla.make.lincomb(z = c(-1, rep(NA, n-2), 1))\nnames(lc1) = \"lc1\"\nThe row of NA in the middle just says to ignore the middle points. Note that we have also ignored the intercept. More on this in a moment.\nNow we can fit the model, using negative binomial errors and specifying our linear combination:\nm1 &lt;- inla(f1,family = \"nbinomial\", data  =  data,\n    lincomb = lc1,\n    control.inla = list(lincomb.derived.only = TRUE),\n    control.predictor = list(compute = TRUE, link = 1)\n)\nAnd the results summary can be obtained (not shown here):\nsummary(m1)\nNote the large estimate for rho, which is the auto-correlation parameter. That happens because we have such a strong decline.\nWe could have also fit just a linear trend to our data, however, because the rate varies over time (and we wouldn’t know that beforehand if we had real data, not data we made up), it is nice to use ar1 which has a kind of smoothing effect.\nAlso worth noting that modelling an trending (non-stationary) time-series with an ar1 is not technically correct if we want to estimate rho or forecast. However, here we use ar1 because it acts like a smoother in a GAM [e.g. see here.\n\n\nExamining the model’s predictions\nIt is pretty straightforward to plot INLA’s predictions for the time-series. They are all stored in the m1 object:\nplot(data$z, data$y, col = 'grey', type = 'l', lwd = 2, xlab = \"years\", ylab = \"Abundance\")\nlines(data$z, m1$summary.fitted.values$mean, col = \"tomato\", lwd = 2)\nlines(data$z, m1$summary.fitted.values[,3], col = \"tomato\", lwd = 1, lty = 2)\nlines(data$z, m1$summary.fitted.values[,5], col = \"tomato\", lwd = 1, lty = 2)\nlegend('topright', legend = c(\"observed\", \"expected\", \"95% CIs\"), lty = c(1,1,2),\n       col = c(\"grey\", \"tomato\", \"tomato\"))\n\nNow we can extract the change in population size from our linear combination:\nm1$summary.lincomb.derived$mean\n\n## [1] -1.081196\nHowever, this is not quite the number we want. It is the change in eta or the linear predictor. Negative binomial models have a log-link, so that is the change in log-space. We want the real change. If we calculate:\n100 * (1 - exp(m1$summary.lincomb.derived$mean))\n\n## [1] 66.08103\nwe get the change as a % from the historical mean The reason being is that the linear combination is log(eta[n]) - log(eta[1]). Taking the exponent gets the change and one minus that is the % loss.\nIt is easy now to get the CIs on the linear combination:\nm1$summary.lincomb.derived\n\n##     ID      mean       sd 0.025quant 0.5quant 0.975quant      mode kld\n## lc1  1 -1.081196 0.309715  -1.695217 -1.08053 -0.4716486 -1.079157   0\nWe could also look at the marginal and plot the posterior distribution of the % loss:\nlosses &lt;- 100 * (1 - exp(m1$marginals.lincomb.derived[[1]][,1]))\ndens &lt;- m1$marginals.lincomb.derived[[1]][,2]\nplot(losses, dens, type = 'l', xlim = c(0, 100),\n     xlab = \"% loss\", ylab = \"density\", las = 1,\n      main = \"Posterior density for % loss\")\npolygon(x = c(losses, rev(losses)),\n        y = c(dens, rep(0, length(dens))), col = \"turquoise3\")"

By evaluating the consequences of development and resource use, it aids in informed decision-making, sustainable management, and the use and protection of Australia’s marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Integrated Ecosystem Assessment has been called for in Australia by the National Marine Science Committee as part of planning Australia ocean use and maximising benefit. In Australia, IEA could support managers and policy makers to find solutions that support triple-bottom line outcomes across multiple use including fisheries, cultural, tourism, aquaculture and renewable energy.\nAims/Objectives Develop modelling approaches for integrated ecosystem assessment that represent the human dimensions and support social-ecological system stewardship. Assess triple-bottom-line outcomes (economic, ecological and social) from changes to management in the marine environment. The focal area will be south-east marine ecosystems, including Bass Strait soft sediment ecosystems and the Great Southern Reef. The work will aim to inform on policies for ecosystem assessment in government and national assessments such as the State of Environment Reporting.\nMethods This project is supported by a CSIRO R+ top-up and project funds. Ecosystem models that include qualitative network models and dynamic end-to-end models will be further developed to include social dynamics. Emphasis will be placed on representing cross-sectorial interactions, such as the influence of offshore infrastructure on changes in fishing distribution, and corresponding changes in ecosystems.\nThe case-study application to Bass Strait will assess dynamic interactions among fisheries, aquaculture, renewables and protected areas. The case-study for the Great Southern Reef will assess interactions among restoration, recreational fisheries and cultural values."

A unique feature of this analysis is that we integrated local knowledge into the analysis of the scientific survey data.\nTo do this, we used a Bayesian GLM, where the rate of decline was informed by both change in fish density in the scientific survey data (2000-2018) and change in the maximum catch rate that local fishers could recall for the 1980s, 2000s and 2018.\nThe integration of local knowledge meant we could verify the declines in catch rate with scientific survey data, and adjust for bias between fisher recall and the surveys. We could then infer the population density in the 1980s, when there were no scientific surveys.\nUnfortunately, the significant magnitudes of the declines over multiple generations suggest these species meet the criteria for being ‘Critically Endangered’ on the IUCN Red List (at least at this local site, if not regionally).\nRead more about the study in the paper:\nHamilton RJ, Hughes A, Brown CJ, Leve T, Kama W.

    "text": "How long does it take to write for major national grants?\nDuring “grant season” (~Dec - March in Aus) you might find your colleagues bemoan all the work they have to do writing grants, or turning down meetings because they are too busy. I certainly felt that way writing for a major Australian Research Council grant this year.\nBut, I wondered how much time does it take to write for a national grant scheme. Since October I have been logging the hours I spend on different projects, like a consultant, in an effort to gain data on project time and improve my time-management. I added up the time I spent writing for an ARC grant, where I was lead author, and the answer surprised me:\n\n69 hours and 30 minutes or nearly 12 full working days (at least1)\n\n\n\nTime spent by days writing for a grant \n\n\nA few caveats on my estimate, which is certainly an under-estimate. It counts writing, formal (organised) meetings with co-authors, budgeting, some reading and all the administrative stuff. The time doesn’t count emails, reading papers, or time thinking while bike-riding, walking the pram, trying to go to sleep etc…\nThe time also doesn’t count time from my colleagues. The grant includes significant input from 3 collaborators and numerous reviews from non-collaborators and research office staff. Also, I started records in November, so prep work before hand (including an internal pre-review) isn’t counted here.\nSome further context for this grant. There is likely to be considerable variability for different people and projects. I am an early career researcher, so maybe my time is slower than more experience researchers, or better writers. However, I did put in for an ARC grant last year so I had a head start on some of the sections about your CV and research contributions. I am also familiar with the ARC format, something I spent a considerable amount of time figuring out the first time I put in for a grant.\nMy grant is also modelling focussed, so that probably saved me some time in the budgeting step, as that could get very tricky if there was lots of field work to budget for.\n\n\n\nThe screen you see on completion of 12 days solid work \n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe 12 days underestimates the mental effort?\n12 days doesn’t sound like as much as I was expecting. However, maybe the raw numbers under-estimate the mental effort that goes into grant writing. I probably have at most 3-4 hours maximal mental effort per day, which makes the grant look more like a month’s solid work, using the best hours of the day.\nI will be interested to hear how much time other people (tweet me) spend on grants and whether my numbers sound reasonable.\nAs a footnote, the message you get when you finally hit submit is rather disappointing (see image). Consider that it takes ~33 hours of climbing to ascend Everest from base camp and you will be rewarded with a view from the top of the world. Or for a computing analogy, if you complete a computer game you are usually rewarded with a video and the solution to the game’s story. It takes only about 13 hours to complete some of the best selling computer games. Obviously the final rewarded is receiving the grant and successfully investigating your ideas, but that is a highly uncertain outcome (~15% success rate for ARCs) that is years down the track. It would be nice if online grant submissions unlocked some kind congratulations page.\n\nNote added 8/03/2016. I have discussed this post with several colleagues all of whom suggests it takes much longer than 70 hours to write a major grant. As I have not included time for reading and thinking in my estimate, it is likely that time would add considerably to the time taken to complete the grant."

    "title": "Why GLMs should be a priority when teaching statistics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There is often debate over the best place to start when teaching students inferential statistics. The teaching of statistics should start with basic understanding of what data are, probability and data visualisation. Beyond that students usually start to learn about inferential methods.\nThe debate then becomes should we start with classic methods like ANOVA, general (and generalized) linear models, or machine learning methods.\nThis debate applies to latter year undergraduate courses (2nd or third year) and also the day to week long workshops that are routinely run using R and or other software.\nI argue that the teaching of inferential statistics should start with general (and generalized) linear models (GLMs).\nGLMs are the foundational framework for model-based thinking, which dominates modern statistical analysis. The general linear model generalizes many of the historical methods for testing and encompasses what were traditionally called ’t-tests, anova and linear regression and ancova.\nThen, extensions of ‘general’ into ‘generalized’ linear models supersede tests for non-normally distributed data such as contingency table tests, logistic regression and even ordination and manova (multivariate stats). Teaching GLMs gives students the overarching principles they need to go away on their own and learn any modern statistical test.\nIn the past we gave students a long list of tools to deal with exceptions, with few common linkages between the different tools. This makes it harder for students to draw a common thread between tools. I think this lack of coherency is a key reason students finish a course but then can’t remember what test they need for a particular situation. We remember things better if they fit within a coherent framework.\nMuch better if students finish the course knowing what is possible, and that they can find the specific tweaks they need for a particular dataset (e.g. modelling a poisson vs gaussian distribution). Students will be much more likely then to be able to find a good model for any data analysis problem they are presented with.\nOne of the arguments for teaching ANOVA first was that it gives students an understanding of how variance is decomposed into difference components of the model (e.g. treatment vs residual error). A fair point, but variance decomposition can also be done with GLM, since ANOVA is just a special case of GLM.\nAn advantage of exploring variance components in a GLM framework is that it also emphasises effect size and facilitates graphical exploration of the analysis. Classic ANOVA methods promote interpretation via tables of numbers (e.g. p-values). The overinterpretatoin of p-values has resulted in many spurious or meaningless findings.\nGLMs encompass both statistical testing (p-values) and estimates of effect size (important to interpret relevance to real world). Effect sizes are then straightforward to visualize through making plots of parameter estimates with confidence intervals, or direclty by making predictions of response for different treatment or covariate values.\nThis leads me to the point that GLMs can be used as a predictive tool. In contrast, a classic ANOVA does not estimate differences in the mean (only variance explained by differences in means), so you cannot predict values of a response variable from an ANOVA. Predictive tools have increasing relevance in modern workforces.\nIn my own area of marine science for instance, fishery scientist may use a GLM to quantify how fish catch varies with different mesh sizes of nets (smaller mesh size will generally will catch smaller fish). The fitted GLM can then be used to make predictions that standardise comparison of catches from nets with different mesh sizes. (Read about another example that is a GLM version of ANCOVA).\n\n\n\nGraph showing GLM predictions of abundance for different habitat areas\n\n\nFigure: Example of using a GLM to correct for differences in habitat use across two regions. In the left panel we model fish abundance just on habitat. However, region 2 has more habitat but no fish, so the fit is negative. On the right we additionally control for region, and see that abundance increases with habitat in region 1.\nThe predictive ability of GLMs is a step towards more sophisticated methods for prediction. Basic GLMs are the first step towards methods that include hierarchical models (random effects), and non-normal distributions (e.g. poisson for count data). Distribution types and hierarchical models are themselves a step towards maching learning and AI methods. Random effects for instance are a type of shrinkage technique. The principle of shrinkage is used across many different model classes (e.g. GAMs, ridge regression, regression trees, neural networks) to improve predictive power.\nThe discussion about what to teach can sometimes be side-tracked about what software to use, often the argument is between R and Python. Now I’m a huge fan of R and don’t know much python, but I think the debate over software is a distraction from the main game.\nMore important is that students learn about quantitative analysis and principles such as the estimation of effect sizes. Some programming is helpful, to give them flexibility of options. Whether they learn that in R or Python is secondary. Obviously the software that is used in their (intended) workplace will be most helpful. However, often it is unknown what software they will encounter most. So just give them the fundamental theory and skills to learn and they will be enabled to adapt and learn on the job."

We are now homeschooling our kids and they are loving it (well only two days in, but so far so good!). The homeschooling is a real break from the rush of the school-commute-work-repeat routine. I’m getting to spend stacks of quality time with my children, and they seem very happy because of that.\nI’m really learning things about them that I hadn’t noticed before, like how interested my eldest child is in moths.\nMore generally, its broadened my perspective on my career. Over the past year or so I’ve been making the transition from individual researcher to team leader. Overall that has been a joy. Watching early career researchers learn and develop their own scientific questions is one of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had in my career.\nBut it also hasn’t always been easy for me. I’ve often felt pushed for time. I’ve tried to maintain my own scientific identity and productivity, as well as put time into supporting this team. I don’t get to do as much actual research myself as I’d like to, because there are so many meetings, emails and admin to do.\nSometimes our research interests align. Sometimes they diverge and I need to put aside my own interests in order to best support you achieving your own goals.\nI’ve faced this transition to team leader with a growth mindset. This has been inspired by outstanding mentors and also the excellent books of Jennifer Garvey Berger.\nCurrent events have really challenged my ‘growth mindset’. But, in truth, there is plenty of growing we can do.\nFor me, if anything, this has really pushed me to focus even more on being a leader of scientists, rather than just a scientist. I feel less concerned about my own research goals now and more focused on supporting careers, PhD completions and healthy lives of my team.\nI’ve never felt more grateful to be part of this amazing research team. We are lucky to have a close network of support in our team and I think our connections will endure, even as we are forced into online life. For me too, thinking of ways to strengthen our group further has been a very positive distraction from all the bad news out there.\nIt’s hard to be optimistic right now and I’m not sure what other opportunities for growth this global situation will present. But there are sure to be many. So let’s keep our eyes and minds open to them.\nYours truly, Chris"

    "text": "International Coral Reef Symposium Day 1 - My highlights\n20 June 2016, Honolulu Hawaii\nSee also my blog on ICRS: Key insights that will be updated daily.\nPlenary\nThe theme of this conference is science to policy and the plenary speakers wasted no time in emphasising the importance of communicating science to broader audiences to the 2500 people in attendance.\nAs evidence of the importance of reef science to policy, there are three presidents from sovereign nations in attendance at the conference.\nRuth Gates, president of the International Society for Reef Studies, wants us to tell the society how to best achieve impact to conserve coral reefs. To this ends, there will be special sessions on Friday to synthesise the conference’s science for policy and public communication.\nBob Richmond, the conference convener, emphasised the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, with scientists, educators and policy-makers in attendance. He said we need to move from academic outputs, like papers, towards policy impact.\nA few stats &gt;1500 oral presentations, &gt;700 posters and 45 sessions. Ruth Gates acknowledged the ‘mammoth’ effort Bob Richmond and the conference organizing team had made to put this together. It’s great to be here and I am certainly grateful for their efforts to bring this event together.\n\n\n\nScience to policy is the central theme of this conference. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nDarwin Award Medal - Jack Randall\nJack Randall received the Darwin award medal, the International Society for Reef Studies highest honour. Dr Randall gracefully accepted the award and told a series of amusing and touching stories from his career.\nDr Randall described purchasing his first aqua-lung. He didn’t know where to get an air tank from, so he went to the welding shop and got a bottle of oxygen (audience gasps). Someone told him later that if he had dived much deeper than he did, he wouldn’t be hear today (oxygen is toxic deeper than about 6 metres).\nDr Randall is an eminent coral reef fish taxonomist whose career has spanned &gt;70 years. During his career he described &gt;700 new marine species and pioneered scientific diving. You can read more about his productive and influential career on Christie Wilcox’s artile for the Hakai Magazine.\n\n\n\nSeveral people noted on Twitter that there have been 7 Darwin awards, but none yet to women. Let’s hope we see more nominations for women for the next award. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nKeynote from President Remengesau of Palau\nPresident Remengesau said that in Palau the ocean is life and it brings us together. He wants us to realize that Palau is not a ‘small island state’ but a ‘large ocean state’. Like many Palauans the ocean is integral to his cultural identity and livelihood. He considers himself a fisherman who has taken time off for public service. Palau has a &gt;1000 year long history of ocean stewardship.\nPalau has established shark sanctuaries and has led the effort to establish protected areas across the Pacific. Economic incentives have been integral to ocean protection. For instance, they have implemented a green tax as part of the depature tax at airports. This helps support ocean conservation efforts.\nAnother example comes from reef sharks, whicha are estimated to be worth $1.9 Million over the course of their lifespan - 100s times more than their value for shark-fin soup.\nTraditional ecological knowledge is the backbone of Palau’s management and governance. Palau’s local scientists (sorry missed the name) emphasised the need to return to traditional governance systems, like species and temporal closures. Subsistence fishing is therefore a key part of their protected area efforts, as it ensures food-security of local people into the future.\nPresident Remengesau believes large marine protected areas are essential for both marine biodiversity conservation and supporting local livelihoods. Palau has declared one of the world’s largest marine protected area systems. This decision is science-based.\nSustainable development of tourism and fisheries while protecting reef biodiversity that is threatened by climate change is a key dilemma faced by many island nations. Palau is pushing back by reducing local stresses to reefs. They are also strongly engaged with global policy push for greenhouse sustainability.\nHe concluded by saying we are at a cross-road for making decisions about the future health of reefs. It is essential to build trusting and long-term relationships to bridging the science to policy gap. We need 2016 to be the year of implementation for projects that can conserve reefs and dependent livelihoods.\n\n\n\nMany people were touched and inspired by a memorial session on reef fish ecology held in honour of Dr Glenn Almany. I only met Glenn a few times, but the science he did has influenced my work and he has left a lasting legacy for coral reef science and conservation. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nCorals of the world\nDr Charlie Veron announced the Corals of the World, an online platform for coral geography and identification. It’s exciting to see coral reef ecology going online and reaching a greater audience.\nEcosystem-based management\nI was in the EBM session this morning. The session was opened by Fogarty, who spoke about the importance of considering trade-offs to achieve ecosystem based management.\nNext up was Brainard, speaking on behalf of Pomeroy about the Coral Triangle Initiative’s Ecosystem Approach to Fishery Management. Brainard defined the Ecological approach to fishery management as trying to achieve a balance between ecological and societal wellbeing through effective governance.\nAgain Brainard emphasised the importance of balancing multiple objectives. Many countries, e.g. PNG, Indonesia, have a history of ecosystem approaches going back to the 90s. We have learned much from these early examples, such as the work on marine protected areas in the Philippines.\nA challenge is that while the principles of ecosystem approach are in national policies, data shortages and barriers to implementation are major challenges.\nLopez-Rivera from NOAA fisheries talked about the challenges of implementing science-based management. An attempt to reform management in Puerto-Rico failed because stakeholders were not willing to compromise on important trade-offs between fishing access and management and they also felt there was not enough evidence to support management changes.\nNash @NasherK reviewed indicators of fishing pressure and found most didn’t quantify actual gradients in fishing pressure!\nNash worked in the Seychelles to develop indicators of fishing pressure. Importantly, high size diversity of herbivorous fish was key to support coral reef resilience. This suggests size diversity is a useful indicator of both fishing pressure and ecological responses to disturbances.\nAltman, from Boston University, talked about how conventional approaches to management focus on protecting the state of ecosystems, e.g. number of species, biomass hotspots and so on. Whereas ecosystem based management often focusses on functions of biodiversity, like services to humans and resilience of ecosystems to disturbance.\nTropicalisation of temperate reefs\nIt has been an interesting year for temperature reefs. Extremely warm ocean temperatures this year, which are driving a global bleaching event on coral reefs, has also seen large migrations of tropical species to temperature waters.\n\n\n\nThis years global bleaching event was on everyone’s mind. Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nAustralia’s south-east reefs are undergoing Tropicalisation. Booth has been doing surveys of tropical fish for many years now to find out which species are moving and to determine the mechanisms driving their movement and establishment success.\nThis summer has been particularly warm and has seen a large increase in the number of tropical fish arriving. Arrivals include surgeon fish - important herbivores on reefs that can change ecosystems through their herbivory. However, most don’t survive the winter, because it is too cold.\nBooth joked that by the next conference, Sydney may house coral reefs. It has happened at a similar latitude in the northern hemisphere!\nSommer is testing the hypothesis that environmental filtering is stronger is areas of high abiotic stress. By looking at the traits of high latitude coral species, they found that species with more similar traits were more likely to survive at higher latitudes. So corals will probably only expand to areas that are similar to their core ranges.\nSommer also found that critical temperatures and temperature variability were more important for controlling coral species range edges than mean temperature - this is an important lesson for predictive modelling.\nOn Australia’s west coast, heat wave events are also seeing unprecedented recruitment of tropical fish in temperate waters. Following these changes will be important for future management of species like this grouper, which are important to fisheries.\nMarine protected areas\nBob Pressey spoke about ineffective targets in conservation planning. Often reserves are ‘residual’ in that they are placed in areas that avoid pressures, like fishing, so don’t actually achieve anything for conservation.\nWe also need to be careful of coverage targets. Conservation objectives for area alone have become institutionalized, but the don’t reflect the quality of protection very well.\nFinally, Pressey talked about the importance of assessing the counterfactual - what would have happened if we didn’t take a management action. For residual reserves what happened will be very similar to the counterfactual, so we discover that our action didn’t really have any impact for improving conservation.\nGabby Ahmadia provided a concrete example of designing a reserve monitoring program to quantify the counterfactual. She used impact evaluation methodology to identify paired ‘control-impact’ sites. They allow comparison of how biodiversity is faring inside protected areas to outside, while controlling for other differences, such as level of exposure to wind and access to markets.\nAhmadia showed that using this thorough evaluation methodology has a large effect on how you classify the success of MPA indicators like fish biomass.\nSemmens presented analysis of citizen science data from the REEF surveys for Bonaire’s marine park. Bonaire’s park has a few small no-take protected areas, but largely allows subsistence fishing. There are many issues with citizen science data, however, Semmens points out that data collected by recreational divers on how many fish they see is ideal to evaluate the tourism experience.\nCeccarelli analysed effects of protection in the Great Barrier Reef marine park. The park mostly protects coral trout - the main fishery species. There is much functional redundancy across multiple species in the system, so overall fish community composition is similar inside and outside reserves.\nThat’s all from me for day 1.

    "title": "Improving fisheries means saving their habitats",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Our new research published in Fish and Fisheries argues that protecting fish habitats is critical to recovering the world’s fisheries (here’s an open access version).\nThe study reviewed the habitat requirements for fish stocks across the globe. Nearly half of those reviewed were found to use habitats that are known to be in decline.\n\nOur guide to assessing the risk of misclassification of stock status when there are unrecorded changes in fish habitat\nOverfishing is often pinned as the only cause of declines in the productivity of fisheries, which implies stricter fisheries regulations are the sole solution to overfishing. We found that nearly half of the world’s best researched fish stocks are using habitats that are in decline, like seagrass and mangroves.\nMany fish habitats are under-threat from human activities like coastal development, pollution and destructive fishing that not only catches fish, but also damages habitats on the ocean floor. Queensland for instance, has lost large areas of its seagrass meadows and mangrove forests to development ¬of coastal infrastructure and pollution.\nThe study looks at how protecting or restoring lost habitats can improve the status of fisheries, so that the fisheries can sustainably support higher catches. If habitats are declining and we don’t know about it, we can mistakenly believe that fish stocks are better or worse off than they actually are (see figure).\nManaging fish catch is an important part of ensuring we have sustainable fisheries that support food production and jobs. But we can’t just count on good fisheries management. Protecting the fish habitats we have left and restoring lost habitats like mangroves is crucial.\nIt has previously been estimated that 31% of fish stocks globally are over-exploited, meaning that catches could be higher if fishing pressure was reduced. But these previous estimates ignored the effects of habitat loss on the productivity of fisheries.\nWe analysed habitat use for 418 of the best researched fish stocks (those in the RAM Legacy stock assessment database). These are stocks for which detailed monitoring data are available. They are commonly used to estimate how sustainable fish are at the global scale.\nThis was a work of several years, first conceived as part of my ARC DECRA project and now has finally reached print. Study co-author Andrew Broadley and I reviewed hundreds of papers to identify what types of habitats were used by the 418 stocks.\nWe also published the results of that review, the data for which is available for free in the Fishscape database.\nThe results suggest we need to look beyond fisheries to other activities that are degrading habitats, like pollution that comes from on land, and coastal development.\n“Restoration of critical fish habitats such as mangroves, seagrass, and floodplains will increase the resilience of fish populations against overfishing. For example, in the Wet Tropics, northern Australia, reconnecting coastal lagoons with mangroves and the Great Barrier Reef has been the primary objective of many restoration projects for fish species such as barramundi to have a better chance of growing and reproducing” said study co-author Dr Fernanda Adame.\nManaging fish habitats can be hard – we need to coordinate our management across the land and sea and across different industries, like infrastructure development and fisheries. But doing so is crucial to supporting the jobs created by fisheries and the opportunity to fish recreationally that is enjoyed by millions of Australians.\nWe hope to continue to use this work to inform our new project on mapping the health of coastal wetlands globally."

Your new supervisor may also not be supportive of you spending time to finish publications from past projects.\nWe discussed this issue with the lab group today. It is topical for some, with Mischa Turschwell starting a new postdoc with us last week.\nAn important point raised was whether your new job was academic (where you are expected to write pubs) or in another area (where papers are not part of the job).

    "section": "General strategies for keeping the pubs going",
    "text": "General strategies for keeping the pubs going\nThe first theme that emerged in discussions was general strategies for keeping up your publication rate, which apply wherever you are in your career. Key amongst these is setting aside high-quality time each week (ideally every morning) for writing. This should be high quality writing time where you just write, no email, looking up references or chatting. You can’t finish papers without writing, but writing is hard so it is easy to put off.\nDespite all the admin activities I have these days, I still set aside several hours 3 days a week for high quality writing time.\nPrioritising projects can also help. If you have multiple old projects to finish, then try to just work on one at a time. Doing too many at once (trust me I make this mistake all the time) splits your attention and you end up making less progress.\nTry these spreadsheet tools from iThinkwell to help you prioritise and stay focused. I used the team writing spreadsheet with papers I lead and those of my students.\nI recently had to work through some tricky reviews that had me very unmotivated about finishing the paper. Seeing it at the top of my priority list helped me focus on getting it done and not being distracted by other more interesting projects.\nIf you have lots of old projects you might want to cull some altogether. Reflect on how complete those old projects are and how much time they need until completion. If it is a lot, it might be worth writing to the co-authors and telling them that you will no longer be leading that paper. Another way to tell if a project should be removed is check in with it 3 months after starting a new academic job. If your new papers are more progressed than this old one, it probably isn’t complete enough to be bothered with anymore.\nRemove them from your priority list (you can always keep a backup list somewhere else). It is demoralising if you list is too long.\nIf you are aiming for academic success, finishing up those old pubs will be key to your success, despite what your new supervisor wants. As a rule of thumb, you should aim to have at least one paper in review at all times by the end of your PhD. I currently have 1-4 papers I’m leading in review at all times. Aim to increase your productivity into your postdoc years by getting more efficient at finishing up past projects (some tips for how are here)."

Laura related a story of getting a job before she even finished her masters. Many weekends and late nights later she finished her masters, all while working in a full-time position.\nAs above you might have to let some things go if it is all too much to fit in. Or you might want to downgrade expectations for your paper.\nFor instance, you PhD supervisor might have been pushing for your to write up a data chapter for a high impact journal, but you would need to include a synthesis of other data-sets from across the globe. Perhaps you could instead focus on just publishing results from your own data and aim for a different more regional journal. Getting something finished is better than nothing."

    "text": "Academic jobs on specific projects\nYour situation here really depends on your supervisor. You are employed on a specific project so it is totally reasonable of them to expect you to spend all working hours working on your new project. Not all supervisors will have this expectation however, so it is worth discussing expectations up front.\nMy own opinion is that a new postdoc can spend some time finishing old projects, so long as they are progressing their new work. For Mischa we discussed he spend his writing time a few days a week getting a paper from his last postdoc finished. The rest of his time can be spent doing the easier tasks of reading and reviewing the datasets we need for his new projects.\nHe is sharing some writing time to work on outlines and concepts for this new paper. Writing is an important part of developing ideas, even if you don’t use those exact words in the final paper.\nHopefully by the time it comes to writing up the new project, the old one will be submitted.\nIt is broadly in a supervisor’s best interests for postdocs to publish their old papers - because it helps the postdoc be more successful in the long-run. Successful postdocs reflect well on their supervisors.\nIf you supervisor requires 100% commitment to the new project, or the new project just has you too busy during the days, then you will have to try the tactics above for jobs that don’t allow you to publish. Just remember, writing is hard and you only get so many good hours of it per day, so you will need to save some brain power for that in mornings (ideal), evenings or weekends."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m over here in Scotland at their National marine science and technology conference (‘MASTS’). There are a lot of talks about the ecological issues associated with green energy derived from wind, waves and tides.\n\nSeeing these environmental issues crop with green energy made me think how lucky the Australian environment is that we are focussing our efforts on deriving and exporting energy created with good old carbon.\nQueensland is leading the way in keeping the coal tradition going, with new coal mines that have recently been criticised by the less enlightened.\nQueenslanders should call our state “The Coal State” not “The Sunshine State” like we currently do. What’s sunshine ever done for us? You can’t run much more than a few web servers with it, and its proven to give you cancer.\nCoal rarely makes people ill, a single power plant causing only about 18 deaths a year in Victoria. Coal also provides stacks of cheap energy.\nA rogue group of scientists believe that climate change is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, such as all the CO2 that comes from burning coal. This extremist group (something like 97% of scientists)) will probably also tell you that climate change has dire consequences for humanity and life on earth.\nWell, even if that is true, the global emissions of carbon are now so huge that Aussie coal mining doesn’t really matter. One mine in Queensland will only contribute about half a percent of the global emissions we have left before the Earth global warming will exceed 2 degrees. 0.5% from just one mine is pretty minor when you consider Australia’s human population is only about 0.33% of the global population.\nWe are also planting heaps of trees in Australia. If you didn’t know it, trees actually suck carbon out of the atmosphere. So the trees we plant are helping to offsett emissions we create from doing things like clearing native forests for farming and burning coal.\nAnyway, the heroin we produce gets sold overseas to countries like India who use it, so it is really their problem. Sorry did I say heroin? I meant coal.\nThose impoverished people in India really need our coal. Having power will raise their standards of living and maybe even their life expectancies. The dirty coal we sell is so cheap everyone can afford it, and the health affects of living near power plants that burn the stuff are pretty unsubstantiated anyway.\nWhat we are doing is putting national interests aside to help humanity at a global scale. We are trading in the land rights of indigenous Australian’s so we can dig up more coal and to give people overseas the chance of cheap power. If that doesn’t balance out historical inequities created by colonialism I don’t know what will.\nConservationists and some scientists will tell you that mining and transporting coal has impacts on local ecosystems too.\nYou can be rest assured that our governments in Australia are very concerned about the environmental impacts of coal mining. Queensland is a state known for its excessive levels of ‘green tape’, which make it difficult for everyday Aussie overseas companys to make an honest profit out of mining.\nThe government’s level of concern is evidenced by the hefty fines they hand out for breaches of environmental protocols. The coal company Adani recently got wacked with a $12,000 fine for letting toxic stormwater spill out into the waters adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.\nAnyway, people matter too. What you can’t dispute is that coal mining provide significant numbers of jobs to honest hard working Australian’s.\nThe creation of a new coal mine may create up to 1500 new jobs over the life of the project.\nEveryone knows the 10s of thousands of ongoing jobs in tourism are not really related to the Great Barrier Reef. All those people are coming for another great Aussie industry - Casinos. But that’s another story.\nSo get behind Australia’s coal mines. Our environment needs coal power as much as our economy does."

Michael Burgass asked me what its twitter impact was, so here is a quick analysis.\nNote that I edited this post (24/08/2017) after Michael Burgass asked me why so few tweets. It turns out (and I hadn’t realised) that the twitter API (Application programming interface) will only return tweets up to 2 weeks old. You have to pay to get older ones. So the data in this post is only relevant to the period over the ICCB conference.\nMichael also asked about #iamaconservationist, but that has too few tweets so far to make for a meaningful analysis (about 100).\nThere were not a huge amount of of tweets over ICCB conference, so it is hard to say too much from a broad brush quantitative analysis like this, but here are a few stats.\nThe first tweet I got was only on 2017-07-26 and until now there have been 813 tweets from 390 users of which 133 are original tweets and the rest RTs.\n\nI think that spike on Wednesday corresponds to EJ Milner-Gulland’s plenary at ICCB.\nThe distribution of tweets per user is not quite as skewed as other hashtags I have analysed. I guess becaues there are fewer users and it is the sort of hashtag that people only post once to (thought they may RT multiple others).\n\n\n\nHere is a table of the most popular tweets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandle\nTweet\n# retweets\n\n\n\n\nMorenaMills\n.@EJMilnerGulland inspiring action and optimism at #ICCB2017 #conservationoptimism #IAmAConservationist.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Improve your writing by practising like a runner trains\nWhenever I complain about about having to edit some writing, my wife likes to remind me that my skill at writing has improved a lot in the past few years. Not that I am great at writing now, what she is saying (in a nice way) is that my writing really sucked a few years ago. My PhD advisors were largely unavailable in the months leading up to submission of my thesis and I was lucky to have her help with a lot of the editing.\n\n\n\nVariety is key to improving your running, and writing\n\n\nWhy has my writing improved from terrible to passable? Well you could put it down to the practice I have had smacking the keyboard since graduating, having written more papers and grants than during my PhD. I also write more regularly now (every day). You need to write regularly to get better, just like you need to run regularly to get fit. Many professionals recommend writing every day, usually in your best working hours, to maximise efficiency.\nWhile regular writing has certainly improved my productivity, I don’t think it’s the whole reason I have improved my writing skill. In fact, if all I did was write papers, my writing would probably be much the same as it was a few years ago.\nI think the reason I have improved at writing is that I have been writing like a runner trains. Writing like a runner wasn’t a deliberate choice, I stumbled on the approach by accident. But now I know it works I advise students to do the same. So here’s the logic.\nIf you are training to run a mid-distance race, like 10kms, you shouldn’t just go out and run 10ks every second day. If you run long distances slowly as training then you will run the race slowly too.\nLooking back at my times in parkrun, a weekly running event I attend semi-periodically, I don’t see any improvement. Probably because I usually just go out for long runs at a comfortable pace and never practice sprinting.\nA better training schedule is to break up some longer distance runs with interval sprint training. Say every second training session you do sprints in intervals. Then you develop both the endurance required for longer events and a faster pace.\nSo how does running training apply to improving your writing?\nWell I think writing papers is analogous to long distance endurance running. It usually takes a long time, you slog over accurately putting methods and findings into words, carefully explaining the study’s implications and ensuring you have used all the appropriate references.\nMost of the writing practice we get in our PhDs is doing the long slow writing of papers and our thesis. That is like only running long-distances. You need to do some sprint writing too.\nSprint writing is one reason I blog. Blogging is fast paced writing. You have an idea, you write it down, edit it once and post it. That’s it. No slogging over finding references, or carefully rewording sentences to get perfect flow (maybe it shows here?).\nAnother way to think about diversity in training your writing is to think about what ‘better writing means’. You can think about better writing in broadly two ways: First, better could mean writing of a higher quality, such as more accurately describing your findings, or creating a more cohesive story. Or you could also be better at writing by writing at the same quality, but doing so faster. To learn to write faster, you need to practice writing faster! Now, I wouldn’t generally advise trying to write papers faster, at least initially. If you make mistakes in papers, that could hurt your reputation. So you need to find another outlet. Blogging is one way to have an outlet for your writing.\nThe second thing I did to improve my writing since graduating was seek professional help. Good runners employ trainers, so why shouldn’t we too. After all, as Joshua Schimel has said, scientists are professional writers. Well I didn’t employ anyone exactly, but I did read Schimel’s book and practice his exercises. I would say there was almost an overnight improvement in my writing (I think my wife agrees).\nAnother problem with trying to improve your writing by writing papers alone is that feedback is typically slow and far between. Psychology tells us that the easiest skills to learn are those were we get instant feedback. Like running or dancing with a trainer who videos you and then critiques your style as you watch the playback.\nIn our group we have recently initiated weekly get togethers to critique each others writing. The idea is to get more frequent feedback on new writing without having to wait to make it through co-author’s inboxes. The sessions have been very popular and I have found, very helpful.\nIncidentally, runners who have a diverse training schedule are also less prone to injury. I speculate that there is an analogue in academic writing. If you do more varied styles of writing you are less likely to burn-out on writing and give up altogether.\nI actually thought of this blog while I was out on a long slow run this afternoon. The idea inspired and I threw a few sprints into my run. Hopefully I can bring this idea full circle and improve my running times too."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Perhaps a stereotype is the young scientist who has graduated from university and is setting out in the world to make a difference. In our field they will be typically concerned with preventing some type of ecological degradation.\nThe stereotype continues that the enthusiastic young person soon becomes old and jaded as they learn to realise that many of the efforts of scientists to communicate impending disaster go unnoticed.\nFinally the once enthusiastic environmental scientist quits and goes off the find ‘a real job’ in banking or perhaps as an accountant.\nMany of us are studying environmental science because we have noticed the many injustices humanity has wrought on nature and we want to do something about it. But ‘doing something about it’ can be much harder than we often think.\nI just attended the MASTS conference in Scotland and there was a lot of talk about the science policy interaction. Some people I met were enthusiastic and hopeful, others were pessimistic about the future of ocean ecosystems. Other expressed dismay at the apparent lack of consideration of evidence by policy makers.\nI think that when I started my career I naively thought making a difference will follow quite a linear path:\n\nDo some science\nTell policy makers about said science\nPolicy makers update policy and laws based on your evidence\nJob done\n\nOn reflection, the road to making a difference is often longer and more indirect than I might have initially hoped. However, having walked that road and watched others do it for about 10 years now, I have seen many successes and many frustrations too.\nProf Peter Tyack, a marine mammal biologist related a story to me about naval sonar excercises causing strandings of beaked whales. The issue was first recognised in about 2000, and it took about 10 years before they were able to get a change in how naval excercises were conducted. But that 10 years of research and engagement with the navy did result in some very positive changes to their operations, which now avoid most the activities that risk causing strandings.\nSo the road to impact often takes longer than you might hope. But there may be unexpected benefits along the way. For instance, the whale researchers have a learned alot about whale echo-location and human acoustic impacts during the research they used to help modify navy operations. This is valuable information as they now confront issues caused by offshore energy development.\nSo if you are on this path to making a difference, or about to start on it, treat it as a learning experience. You might not have an impact in the way you initially hoped, but in trying to do so you will learn better ways for next time.\nI think there are some things we can do in our careers that will help us in your quest to make a difference.\nExperiment with different courses of influence. See what works for you. Here are some ways you can use a career in science make a difference, there are many more:\n\nWork with government staff to inform their policies/legislation\nEngage with the public media on issues and comment as an expert\nWork with environmental NGOs to inform how they spend their funds\nWrite a letter to your local politician about an issue\nReview environmental policies\nContribute to calls for public comment\nWrite a critique of government policy\nDonate what you can to environmental causes and maybe even try to get a better paid job so you can donate more (seriously, some people see this as the best way to make a difference)\n\nNone of these courses is direct, but all can have impact. The more often and more immediately you can start experimenting with many different paths for making a difference, the sooner you will get good at it.\nBuild trust and integrity with policy/decision makers. A good point that one of the presenters at the conference made. They also noted we often focus now on learning good communication skills - which are also important. However, working with policy makers also requires them to trust you. Building trust and integrity takes time and long-term relationships. So the sooner you start working with decision makers the better.\nSome ways to build trust and integrity are:\n\nGain the esteem of other scientists. Having other people say you are good helps build you integrity. Yes, in the science world the best assured way to get the esteem of your colleagues is to publish, publish, publish.\nGet a relevant qualification (like a PhD). Also, make sure you let people know you have it. You can do this subtly, like putting it in your email signature.\nWrite a book about an issue. Papers are good, but books establish that you have a broader or greater knowledge of a topic are often more accessible to non-scientists.\nBe in the public eye and provide incisive and reliable commentry. Like getting engaged with the media, as above\nJoin a professional society, like the Society for Conservation Biology\n\nFinally, one of the most helpful things you can do is make your science policy relevant. A good example came up today of experimental studies that look at the impacts of multiple toxins on organisms.\nSuch work often uses unrealistically extreme levels of toxins, to make sure they find some effect if it is really there (and have something to publish). But such extreme experiments are not that helpful for setting water quality guidelines. If you could also test toxicity at environmentally relevant levels, say at existing legislated thresholds for what constitutes pollution, then you might have some results that can more directly inform policy (maybe they should reduce the threshold!).\nThis is in fact what Tyack did with this work on how sound impacts whales. They determined the db above which whales responded. Thus, the navy could set limits for how loud their equipment could be when there were whales around.\nSo if I am ever lucky enough to see a beaked whale, I will remember I may well have have marine mammal scientists to thank that they are still around. Knowing the work you do has helped the environment is the fuel you need for persisting in a career in science."

For instance, researchers are usually motivated by a sense of purpose, such as helping the environment. Most research also requires working with and around other people.\nBut I think supervisors and universities can do more to meet the demand for developing leadership skills in PhD students."

If leadership is important to you, ask potential supervisors how they help leaders grow. Ask them if they support students to take on other roles that help develop leadership, like volunteering for societies. And look at what their grads have gone on to do.\nMany well established and renown labs will offer more traditional training, which will emphasise training in a scientific field over developing more diverse skills in leadership.\nSome highly productive labs create a lot of research that fits nicely with the supervisor’s own research goals, but are not necessarily training students who will be leaders in a topic of their own choosing.\nI think that an important part of developing leaders is helping students develop their own research questions, which should stem from what intrigues them. So ask prospective supervisors some questions to see how far they would be willing to support you in developing your own research interests."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A fast start to R scripts\n\n\nI recently heard about the Atom text editor. It has been designed for coders by coders. The idea is to have a text editor that works on any OS and is hackable. That means you can customise any of its features, or write your own features. It acheives OS independence by using web-technology, i.e. Javascript and CSS. If you know these it is easy start hacking Atom, if not, they are not that hard to learn (certainly easier than R!). Regardless, you don’t need to know any programming language to use Atom. I am now trying it out for R programming.\n\n  &lt;p&gt;\n     In the past I have primarily used the R inbuilt scripter for writing\n     code and RStudio for teaching. My hope is that Atom will make life\n     easier and will also be flexibile, but easy enough to use for teaching.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n\nTo help convince you about why switching to Atom is a good idea, here is an example of one of its cool features:  Snippets\n\n\n\n\n\nAtom Snippets allow you to type a shortcut and hit tab, and it will fill in the rest for you. One way to use Snippets would be to set up Snippets for common program structures, to save you time in re-writing them every time you start a new project\n\n\nOne of the most common things to do in R is to import data and manipulate it into a usable form. So here is a step by step guide for how to set up such a snippet in Atom\n\n\nStep 1: Install Atom\n\n\nAtom is available here\n\n\nStep 2: Open Your Snippets\n\n\nGot to the ‘Atom’ menu and select ‘Open your snippets’\n\n\nStep 3: Write your snippet\n\n\nSnippet code uses the .cson (CoffeeScript Object Notation) structure to delineate commands and code. Here is an example to create a common R script:\n\n &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;'.source.r':\n  'R data import':\n    'prefix': 'R_data_import'\n    'body': \"\"\"\n    rm(list = ls())\n    setwd('')\n    library(dplyr)\n    library(tidyr)\n    dat &lt;- read.csv('.csv', header = TRUE)\n    head(dat)\n    \"\"\"&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;\n\nThe first line is the file type, the second line is the name, the third line is the shortcut name and the fourth line ‘body’ is the snippet. You can enclose multiline snippets in ‘“““’ as I have done here.\n\n\nNow, create a new file and save it with the ‘.r’ (lower case is important) extension. When you start writing your file type ‘R_data_’ and a drop down box should appear. Scroll down and select ‘R_data_import’ and hit tab. It should auto-fill your script and you are ready to begin with some data wrangling.\n\n\nIf you want to evalute code you write in Atom, check out Atoms ‘eval-r’ package (OSX only)."

These stressors can interact in unpredictable ways that can expedite the rate of taxonomic and functional extinction, or reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions.

Science needs to progress beyond simple ‘additive’ models and consider the processes that underlie interactions among stressors, so we can make more accurate predictions about how stressors interact.

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nConservation management aims to avoid species extinction, whether that is taxonomic extinction or functional extinction. But, we never really know why species go extinct. There are typically too many circumstantial stressors of an organism to be able to partition out which one caused the extinction. Here I define stressors as human caused changes to the environment that have a detrimental effect on a marine population or ecosystem. Examples include mortality from fisheries by-catch and sub-lethal stressors like toxins that affect reproductive health. For instance, one of the most famous examples of extinction was the extinction of the Caribbean Monk Seal. The monk seal’s extinction was ostensibly caused by hunting, but overfishing of their food resources may also have contributed (McClenachan and Cooper 2008). Dugong, an important herbivore of seagrass meadows may also be functionally extinct along many areas of Queensland’s coast, having decline 97% since the 1970s (Hughes et al. 2005). Their decline has been caused by a combination of habitat loss from poor water quality, hunting, boat strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Determining the cause of these declines is important for identifying what actions managers can take to avert those declines.\nMost marine ecosystems are affected by multiple stressors (Halpern et al. 2015), making it hard to attribute a population’s decline to any single stressor. Stressors can also interact in unexpected ways, meaning that population declines can occur faster or slower than we might have expected based on their effects in isolation (Côté et al. 2016). Thus, extinction is often driven by the inextricable combination of multiple stressors. The inseparable effects of multiple stressors poses several challenges to the science of extinction and to the management of nature, both of which tend to be reductionist.\nFirst, there is the estimation challenge: in the wild systems that we study it is arguably more common to observe multiple confounding stressors acting at once, rather than their effects in isolation. Therefore, it can be difficult to measure the impact of individual stressors and determine what benefits (or not) acting on one or the other might bring for averting extinction.\nSecond, there is the uncertainty challenge: stressor interactions mean that actions on single stressors may have unexpected outcomes, and actions to address one stressor may sometimes even worsen the population’s decline. How stressors interact to affect a population will often remain unknown. In fact, stressors are now so globally extensive that the number of potential interactions we could study will in most region far exceed the capacity of science to measure those interactions. Thus, when determining the benefits of conservation actions, managers need to act in the face of considerable uncertainty about those benefits.\nFinally, there is the prioritization challenge: management agencies have constraints on what they can do, often for economic (e.g. budget) or social (e.g. conflicting human uses of the marine environment) reasons. When choosing what actions to take to lessen stressors, management must decide how to prioritise to find those actions that give the best outcomes for the population given the constraints they face.\nHere I will ask what managers and science can do to avert extinctions in the face of multiple stressors that have uncertain interactions. The focus will be on managing multiple different types stressors, not cumulative impacts. Cumulative impacts science is an all encompassing term that includes the impacts of repeat events of the same stressor (e.g. multiple marinas) and also the impacts of multiple different stressors on populations. When assessing the impact of multiple stressors we often need to consider how they will interact.\nFirst, I will provide a conceptual overview for how multiple stressors can interact to affect marine populations (the field is in disarray with only broad agreement on how to even classify different types of interactions). Second, I will examine the prevalence of different types of interactions and ask whether we can ever make educated guesses about how stressors interact (perhaps soon, but the science is not established yet). Third, in situations when interactions are unknown I will ask what is the safest for managers to assume and I will describe the paradox of managing interacting stressors. Finally, I draw on the conservation planning literature to provide a revised road map for managing multiple (and potentially interacting) impacts."

    "section": "Conceptual overview of interactions among multiple stressors",
    "text": "Conceptual overview of interactions among multiple stressors\nAt a conceptual level, interactions among multiple stressors occur when stressors interact via some physical or biological process. For instance, interactions can be purely driven by physical process, such as warming polar oceans also causing freshening due to sea ice melt (Boyd and Brown 2015). Examples of biological processes underlying interactions include the increased susceptibility of corals to bleaching in clearer water (due to light stress). Ecological interactions can also cause stressor interactions, due to feed-backs within food-webs. For instance, ocean acidification and fishing may interact to affect some benthic molluscs by slowing their growth, but fishing will reduce predation pressure.\nWhen we quantify interactions we need a null model with which to compare our observations (from the field or experiments) with our expectation. In the past these null models have been based on the ANOVA methodology. Therefore, if we want to know how two stressors interact, we measure the response variable (e.g. growth of seagrass) in a crossed trial. The interaction is then measured as the difference between the sum of effects from the single stressor trials and the outcome of the crossed trial. If the outcome of the crossed trial is greater than the sum then the interaction is said to by synergistic, if it is less than the sum then the interaction is said to be antagonistic.\nInteractions matter if you are managing just a single stressor. From a management perspective a synergy will mean declines happen faster than you expected in the combination of two stressors, but that acting on one stressor brings a serendipitous benefit in terms of reducing that stressor and its interaction with another stressor (Brown et al. 2013).\nFor instance, we could speculate that poor water quality and boat traffic would have a synergistic impact on dugong population trends. Poor water quality reduces the growth of seagrass the food of dugongs. Boats can collide with dugongs causing injury and death. Dugongs will travel to find high quality food patches (e.g. Sheppard et al. 2010). This may increase the risk of boat strikes. So we could infer that by improving water quality so that seagrass grows more densely we may also serendipitously reduce the risk of boat strikes. Therefore, the benefit of actions on water quality has an additional benefit in terms of reducing boat mortalities.\nAn antagonism means that acting on one stressor may be ineffective, because the other stressor still dominates. In some cases you may also have mitigative interactions, whereby acting on one stressor actually makes the impacts of the other stressor worse.\nAntagonisms can occur when you have dominance effects. For instance, say that toxins and disease are most likely to kill old or weak seals. Then if we have a disease outbreak in an area that has a high toxin load, we might see little additional seal deaths – the toxins already killed all the susceptible seals!\nAntagonisms can also be mitigative, meaning that one stressor weakens or even reverses the effect of another (such effects have also termed mitigating synergies). Such mitigative effects may often occur in food-webs. e.g. if two stressors have a synergistic effect on a species predator, then their combination may have an mitigative effect on the prey species.\nSo determining and classifying the type of interactions occurring between multiple stressors is important for management.\nCan we predict how two stressors will interact?\nIt will often be important to predict how stressors interact without having to collect new data to determine those interactions (Côté et al. 2016). For instance, we might be limited in our funding or time we have to gather new information that allows us to make the most effective decision. Therefore, it would be helpful if we could predict a-priori how strongly two stressors may interact.\nIn the past the scientific literature has been most concerned with identifying synergies. It is easy to see why, they potentially mean biodiversity will under go much greater declines than we expect based on reductionist science that studies a single stressor in isolation. So, is there any reason to expect that synergies will be particularly prevalent?\nNumerous meta-analyses of experimental studies have shown that synergies are no more prevalent than antagonisms or just additive interactions. In fact, you tend to just get a 1/3 each way (Côté et al. 2016). That interactions are apparently random means it will be hard to predict a-priori what the outcome will be.\nHowever, if you look across multiple meta-analyses (a meta-analysis of the meta-analyses!) and ask when and where interactions occur you do observe some generalisations (Côté et al. 2016). Antagonisms are most likely to occur at the community/ecosystem level, for instance in the response of diversity of community biomass to multiple stressors. This may be because ecosystems have many self regulating feed-back loops that mitigate the effects of stressors.\nAntagonisms are rare at the physiological level (e.g. for responses like respiration and photosynthesis). At this level additive and synergistic interactions are more likely. At the individual organism or population levels (e.g. growth, abundance, behaviour) you tend to see a mix of interaction types.\nFurther work is needed to explore why these generalities occur. One reason may be that different disciplines actually apply different definitions to determine what is synergistic vs. antagonistic. See Piggott et al. 2015 for a detailed discussion of different approaches to classifying interactions.\nThis confusion in the scientific literature about what constitutes a synergistic or antagonistic interaction is a challenge for making management decisions. What we are really interested in for managers is: what is the benefit of acting on one stressor for the population?\nI think we need to move beyond the simple definition of interactions based on comparison to an additive model and think more about how process models can inform on types of interactions. While we often know very little about how two stressors interact, we may in fact know a lot about the processes by which a population responds to a stressor.\nWe can build experiments in process models of multiple stressors to predict what the outcome of managing a single stressor will be.\nFor instance, Viv Tulloch, my PhD student modelled Baleen whale recovery from harvesting in the Southern Ocean (Tulloch et al. 2017). Through her co-supervisor Eva Plaganyi, she was able to obtain data on historic catches on whales from the International Whaling Commission. She also obtained corrections for the ‘missing Soviet catches’ between 1947 and 1973.\nShe developed a whale population model that accurately reflected past trends in whale population size. The model was also coupled to climate and low-trophic level models that predict trends in Antarctic Krill biomass, a key prey source for Baleen whales.\nRecovery for Blue and Fin whales are considerably slower post-harvesting when compared the coupled climate model to a model with constant climate, indicating an important interaction between the cessation of harvesting pressure and climate.\nIn future work she intends to explore how a fishery for krill may affect these recovery trajectories, and thus can provide advice on how krill catches should be regulated to enable whale recovery.\nProcess models of interactions also end up making a better ‘null’ model than the old ANOVA model. If our observations of decline end up being greater (synergistic) or less than (antagonistic) what our process model predicted, then we know we are missing something that requires further study. Ultimately this is what a good null model should do, test our predictions and help us identify areas where the theory needs more work.\nSee the report by the Committee on the Assessment of the Cumulative Effects of Anthropogenic Stressors on Marine Mammals (2017) for an excellent example of how we can predict the interaction of two stressors that are of a similar type (e.g. both toxins).\nThe idea of using process models to predict interactions is a subject of ongoing work for me.\nFor instance, see the below figure, where I predict the impacts of trawling and turbidity on seagrass area using a simple process model (left) and the standard additive impacts model used in many maps (right, e.g. Halpern et al. 2013).\n\nThe cumulative impacts model suggests that reducing trawling will have the same benefit for seagrass, regardless of the turbidity. Whereas, the process model ways reducing trawling will have the greatest benefit when turbidity is moderate. This occurs because trawling removes seagrass, whereas turbidity slows seagrass growth. Therefore, seagrass area will be less able to regrow into the empty patches created by trawling when turbidity is higher."

    "section": "Applying science to the management of multiple stressors",
    "text": "Applying science to the management of multiple stressors\nGiven our limited ability to predict how multiple stressors will interact, what actions should managers take in the face of uncertainty? One thing a manager could do is make a pragmatic assumption of a certain type of interaction and use that to inform safe, or risk-averse, decisions.\nParadoxically, a manager who is concerned with conserving a species should assume stressor interactions are synergistic if there are estimating the magnitude of population decline, but antagonistic if they are deciding what to do about the decline. I call this the “paradox of multiple stressor interactions”.\nWhy does this paradox occur?\nWell if you are trying to predict the magnitude of a decline from information about the impacts of single stressors the most risk-averse assumption is that in combination those stressors will have a greater than additive effect.\nHowever, if have observed a population decline in the presence of multiple confounded stressors, assuming their interaction is antagonistic compels you to act on both at the same time. If you were to assume their interaction was synergistic, acting on one stressor may have little benefit for the population if the interaction was in fact antagonistic (Brown et al. 2013).\nWhen one stressor is ‘unstoppable’, such as a stressor related to climate change that a local manager cannot act on, then you need to try act on the other stressor in refuges from the unstoppable one. For instance, restoring water quality on coral reefs in areas that are natural refuges from bleaching and cyclones (Brown et al. 2014).\nSo in practice, what do managers tend to assume currently? My PhD student Laura Griffiths, is currently looking for an answer for this question, and she is reviewing scores of management plans for coastal ecosystems to see how management of multiple stressors is approached in practice. We would be glad to take feed-back and suggestions on this lit review if you have comments.\nMy suspicion is that management plans may often assume ‘additive’ (ie no) interaction among stressors. I base this assumption on the fact that ‘threat mapping’ has now become quite prevalent as tool to inform management. Threat maps typically assume stressors don’t interact, a design decision that was intended to be ‘conservative’. In fact we now know that additive interactions are very optimistic if you are seeking the quantify the benefits of acting on a stressor."

    "section": "Road map for prioritizing conservation actions when managing multiple stressors",
    "text": "Road map for prioritizing conservation actions when managing multiple stressors\nTo conclude, I wanted to provide a brief road map for prioritizing actions to avert population decline in the face of multiple stressors. This road map is largely based on conservation decision science and particularly the application of cost-effectiveness to prioritizing decisions (see (Game et al. 2013, Brown et al. 2015, Giakoumi et al. 2015)), but with a few twists to account for interactions.\nWe will step through the road-map using a simplified example of Moreton Bay’s dugongs. I have skipped some of the details of conservation decision making, but you can read more in the papers I have mentioned. For simplicity we will consider just two stressors, though the same concepts apply if we have more stresors.\n\nStep 1: Determine the objective and constraints on conservation actions\nPrioritization needs to begin with the objective you are seeking to maximise or minimise. At this point you should also identify constraints. In a conservation context the objective will often be to avoid or reduce the rate of population decline and common constraints are budgetary or social (e.g. closing fishing grounds) constraints. For the dugongs, our objective is to avert population decline in Moreton Bay. An important constraint is the budget we have to spend on management measures.\nIt is important that the objective is precise, because the spatial and temporal extent of our objective will affect which actions can most effectively achieve that objective (Game et al. 2013, see also steps below). For instance, we may take a very different set of actions if our objective is to conserve some dugongs anywhere in Moreton Bay, versus having a high density of dugongs in a particular place.\n\n\nStep 2: Determine actions that will be prioritized\nScientists often talk about prioritizing places, threats or species. But places, species and threats do not consume the resources conservation is constrained by, the actions to protect them do. This has resulted in many misleading conservation plans that prioritize places without saying what you will do there. For the dugongs, the actions are closing areas to boat traffic to protect them from collisions or catchment management measures that will improve water quality in the bay and enhance growth of their key food – seagrass. If there are important unknowns we could also specify actions that are to learn about a threat. For instance, shark fishing may have caused population declines in sharks an important predator of dugongs (e.g. Wirsing et al. 2007)\n\n\nStep 3: Determine the cost of available actions\nFor the actions to protect dugongs, the associated costs are the costs of planting trees (to reduce erosion and improve water quality) and the cost of enforcing areas closed to boating. A more complex and thorough consideration of costs might also consider social and political costs of these actions.\n\n\nStep 4: Determine the benefits of competing actions\nWe want to know what benefit each action brings to our objective. For the dugongs this is simply the improvement in the population growth rate if we implement either or both actions. At this point it is important to consider the potential for interactions among the stressors that may influence the effectiveness of the actions. Ideally we will have a long time-series of dugong population trends in areas with crossed combinations of the different stressors. However, such an abundance of data is unlikely. A more pragmatic approach is therefore to model, either conceptually or quantitatively, the processes by which the stressors affect the population.\nFor instance, earlier I speculated that boat strikes and poor water quality will have synergistic impact on dugong population trends (because hungry dugongs are more likely to encounter boats). We could use a simple GIS model to estimate the likely magnitude of this interaction. For instance, we could quantify whether we thought dugong travel distances under low food conditions, as estimated by animal tracking studies would likely bring dugongs into contact with a greater number of boats. We could then use a demographic model to estimate the impacts of boat strikes on overall population growth.\n\n\nStep 5: Prioritize actions based on their cost effectiveness\nNow we understand the costs, benefits and interactions between different actions we should use a quantitative prioritize to choose the set of actions that maximises dugong population growth. One simple method is to calculate the cost-benefit ratio and use this to choose actions until we have expended all of the budget (e.g. Giakoumi et al. 2015).\nIf we have modelled the interactions correctly, then their importance will be apparent at this stage, without us having to explicitly consider it. For instance, it may be that the serendipitous benefit of conserving seagrass for reducing boat strikes is so great that this is all we need to do to save the dugongs. On the other hand, it may be that the number of boat strikes each year is so great that it outweighs any seagrass food effects, and thus it is essential that we act on boat strikes to achieve any benefits for dugongs.\n\n\nStep 6: Sensitivity of the action plan to interactions\nA final step is to consider the sensitivity of the action plan to uncertainties in this process. Uncertainty could creep in anywhere, but in the context of multiple stressors, this means repeating the prioritization assuming different types of interactions. The optimal set of actions will then be chosen based on the decision makers preference for risk.\nA risk-averse manager will use the sensitivity analysis to identify actions that are always effective regardless of how the stressors interact. For instance, we may want to focus actions that halt boat traffic in regions that have the best existing water quality (this is in fact the management arrangement we have in Moreton Bay), a strategy that will successfully save some dugongs regardless of whether boating and seagrass interact synergistically or antagonistically.\nA risk-seeking manager may want to do the converse – identify which set of actions has the greatest maximal benefit. “Go hard or go home” would be the motto for such a manager. Their objective is to have a pristine dugong population or none at all. Such a manager will throw all their resources at the set of actions that have the greatest potential benefit, but which may also have the greatest risk of failure."

    "text": "Concluding statements\nI have argued that contemporary conservation management must consider the potential for interactions among multiple stressors. Interactions that cause more rapid declines than we might expect paradoxically offer the greatest potential for managers to avert extinctions. We need more science to try to identify generalities in how stressors interact, because we can never hope to study all potential interactions. An important way forward is to incorporate our understanding of stress processes into models that can predict the impact of multiple stressors on populations. Doing so will provide more accurate predictions to managers, and also more useful null models for testing scientific theories. Decision makers faced with managing multiple stressors should consider all potential interactions and make decision that take account of the potential risk of misestimating the benefits of conservation actions."

    "title": "Generalized Linear Models understanding the link function",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Generalized Linear Models (‘GLMs’) are one of the most useful modern statistical tools, because they can be applied to many different types of data. Count, binary ‘yes/no’, and waiting time data are just some of the types of data that can be handled with GLMs.\nWe often call such data ‘non-normal’ because its distribution doesn’t follow a normal distribution (also known as the bell curve or Gaussian Distribution).\nIn this post I will look at how GLMs use a ‘link function’ to model non-normal data. I think there is a sort of beautiful elegance in the maths of how the link function works. Understanding this theory will also help you build better models for your data and interpret them in more nuanced ways.\nWe will step through the math behind the GLM and build it up from scratch.\nGLMs extend ‘General Linear Models’ (confusing names I know), read this post first if you are not yet familiar with General Linear Models.\nThanks is due to Brad Biggerstaff for emailing some errors in terminology in my original post (which I’ve updated and hopefully fixed 19/10/2018).\n\n\nI learned about the Normal distribution in primary school. The normal distribution is central to much of statistics (no pun intended), but there are many types of data that don’t meet the basic assumptions of the normal.\nThe normal distribution has ‘infinite support’, which means values modelled by the normal can take any negative or positive number. Often the normal is a pretty reasonable approximation of data that doesn’t meet these assumptions, but there are many cases when using a normal for data that isn’t will lead us to make errors in our inferences.\nStatisticians have invented whole families of distributions to describe any type of data you can imagine, from the morbid (the Exponential distribution for deaths or decay), to wealth inequality (the Pareto distribution) and even days of the year (the Von Mises distribution).\nMore specifically, we should think of the distribution as a description of the process that generates the data.\nLet’s start with something simple. Let’s assume you have been counting fish on coral reefs. So your data are count data.\nIf the counts are large they may well look pretty normal. But there are some important differences.\nCounts are integers, whereas the normal distribution is for continuous data that can include any fraction.\nCounts also can’t be less than zero, but the Normal distribution model’s stochastic processes that draw zeros and negative numbers.\nStatisticians have invented many distributions for counts, one of the simplest is the Poisson distribution. It is a model of positive integers. It has one parameter λ, which is both its mean and variance.\nLet’s see what that looks like with some simple R code to draw random numbers from two Poisson distributions:\nn &lt;- 1000\nset.seed(42)\nx1 &lt;- rpois(n, lambda = 1)\nx10 &lt;- rpois(n, lambda = 10)\nmean(x1)\n\n## [1] 0.976\n\nvar(x1)\n\n## [1] 0.9663904\n\nmean(x10)\n\n## [1] 10.083\n\nvar(x10)\n\n## [1] 10.75086\nWe just sampled random numbers from two Poisson distributions with means of 1 and 10. Notice that the means and variances of each are approximately equal (not exactly equal because of we drew a small random sample).\nYou can think of this sampling from the Poisson as a model of count data. Let’s see what that looks like:\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nhist(x1, xlim = c(0, 25), seq(0, 25, by = 1))\nhist(x10, xlim = c(0, 25), seq(0, 25, by = 1))\n\nSo the data drawn from the poisson with lambda = 1 are concentrated near zero and strongly skewed (not very Normal). The data with lambda = 10 are approximately normally distribution and have a much larger variance than the former data.\n\n\n\nSo far our Poisson model only has one parameter, a mean (and variance). But what if we wanted the mean to change?\nFor instance, we might have counted fish on different types of coral reefs and we want to test whether there are difference abundances on each type of reef.\nOr we might have counted fish across a gradient of pollution and we want to know how their numbers change from low to high pollution.\nI will call these hypothesized causes of changes in fish counts ‘covariates’. Others might call them explanatory variables, treatments (if experiments) or predictor variables.\nWe are using Generalized Linear Models, so we could include the covariates as variables in a simple linear equation, after all that is what we do with linear regression (and general linear models):\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nLet’s generate some such data ourselves. We will assume pollution is measured on a zero to one (low to high) scale, that the mean number of fish with no pollution =4 and that on average there are no fish anymore when pollution levels = 0.5 (half their maximum).\nThe plot below illustrates our model for the mean expected number of fish across the pollution gradient. In this case we are building a model to simulate some data to practice with:\nn &lt;- 50\nbeta &lt;- -8 #effect of polluted reefs\nalpha &lt;- 4 #intercept = mean at 'zero' pollution\nx &lt;-  seq(0, 1, length.out = n) #pollution levels\nymean &lt;- alpha + beta*x\nplot(x, ymean, type = 'l', xlab = \"Pollution level\", ylab = \"Number of fish counted\")\nabline(h = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 2)  \n\nThere is something odd about this model: we are predicting negative fish (on average) for pollution levels over 0.5.\nIt gets even worse if we model sampling with a normal distribution:\nset.seed(55)\nyobs_normal &lt;- ymean + rnorm(n)\nplot(x, ymean, type = 'l', xlab = \"Pollution level\", ylab = \"Number of fish counted\")\npoints(x, yobs_normal)\nabline(h = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 2)\n\nClearly if we went in the real world to sample data, we wouldn’t ever get any negative counts.\nSo we are going to have to redesign our model, which is the basis of our statistical tests, so that negative values don’t happen.\nBut we still want to use a linear model, because they are convenient to work with mathematically and convenient when it comes to estimating the unknown effects.\n\n\n\nSo now we come to link functions. Link functions elegantly solve the problem of using linear models with with non-normal data. There are many types of link functions, but we will look at one that is popular for use with count data.\nIf you wanted to stop a linear function from taking negative values what is one simple transformation you could make?\nWell, you could take the function’s exponent. We will redo the above linear equation as log-linear. I will change the parameter names to reflect that they are now logs:\ngamma &lt;- -3.2 #effect of polluted reefs\nalpha &lt;- 4 #intercept = mean at 'zero' pollution\nyexp &lt;- alpha*exp(gamma*x)\nplot(x, yexp, type = 'l', xlab = \"Pollution level\", ylab = \"Number of fish counted\")\nabline(h = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 2)\n\nHere we have the equation y = alpha *exp(gamma*x) which is the same as the linear equation for log(y): log(y) = log(alpha) +gamma*x. Note I have retained alpha=4 in both, because for both equations alpha is the expected value at pollution of zero.\nI changed the slope parameter in the log-linear equation to gamma because it is not a direct analogue of our slope parameter beta above.\nOne of the nice things about the log-linear equation is that the slope parameter now represents multiples of change. For instance, gamma = -3.2 means the abundance declines about 25 times decline (=1/exp(-3.2)) when going from a pollution level of 0 to 1.\nAbundance declines about a five times decline if we go from a pollution of 0 to 0.5 (= 1/exp(-3.2*0.5)). Noting this will be important when we come to interpreting fitted models below.\nWe could now use this exponential curve as the mean (and variance!) of a Poisson:\nyobs_pois &lt;- rpois(n, yexp)\nplot(x, yexp, type = 'l', xlab = \"Pollution level\",\n     ylab = \"Number of fish counted\",\n     ylim = c(0, 8))\npoints(x, yobs_pois)\n\nNotice that no data fall below zero now. Also, notice how the variance of the samples gets smaller as the mean gets smaller.\n\n\n\nIn the real world, you will have the sample points, but not the ‘true’ mean. In the example above we just made up the true mean ourselves. In the real world Nature provides the ‘truth’ about how pollution impacts fish abundance and the best we can do is take as many measurements as we can and hope to get near the truth.\nTo estimate the effect of the pollution covariate you can use R’s glm() function:\nm1 &lt;- glm(yobs_pois ~ x, family = poisson(link = \"log\"))\ncoef(m1)\n\n## (Intercept)           x\n##    1.409704   -3.345646\nThe values we printed give the estimates for the intercept and slope coeffcients (alpha and gamma). You can check that these are similar to the true estimates we provided by comparing them to log(alpha) and gamma.\nI have specified above the type of distribution to use (family = poission()) and which link to use. \"log\" is in fact the default choice, but I put it there so you know you can change it.\nFor instance, you can use \"identity\" link for data that is far from zero. If you use the identity link, which is basically no link function, your model will be linear, not log-linear, so your slope estimate will once again be additive.\nTechnically we would say we fitted a Poisson Generalized Linear Model with a log link function. So the model’s predictions for the data will be Poisson distributed about its estimate for the mean. Note that the data can contain zeros, but the mean of the Poisson is always &gt;0.\nSo what do the coefficients mean? Remember the coefficients are on the log scale. So the mean abundance at a pollution level of zero = {r} exp(coef(m1)[1]) and a change in pollution from 0 to 1 causes an estimated {r} 1/exp(coef(m1)[2]) times decline in fish abundance.\nLet’s also plot the fitted model with standard errors.\nypredict &lt;- predict(m1, type = \"response\", se = TRUE)\nplot(x, yexp, type = 'l', xlab = \"Pollution level\",\n     ylab = \"Number of fish counted\",\n     ylim = c(0, 8))\nlines(x, ypredict$fit, lwd = 2, col = \"red\", lty = 2)\n#Add lines for standard errors\nlines(x, ypredict$fit + ypredict$se.fit, lty = 3, col = \"red\")\nlines(x, ypredict$fit - ypredict$se.fit, lty = 3, col = \"red\")\n#plot observations\npoints(x, yobs_pois)\nlegend('topright', legend = c(\"True mean\", \"Estimated mean\"),\n       lwd = 2, lty = c(1,2), col = c(\"black\", \"red\"))\n\nYou can see the fitted line falls close to the ‘true’ line, and the standard errors are pretty tight around our best estimate.\nThe fitting algorithm itself is attempting the maximise the log-likelihood of the observations given the mean (in technical speak). You can read more about likelihoods here.\nIt is also worth noting that we still need to do assumption checks, like we would for a regression with normal errors. For instance, we can check the model’s residuals (the difference between the data and the model’s predicted values) to see that the residual variance approximately equals the mean. A cool way to check assumptions of the Poisson model is to use ‘rootograms’, look it up.\n\n\n\nSo in my introduction I claimed that maths of GLMs is beautiful. I think that because the maths is nicely coherent with the way nature often works.\nWe wanted to fit a linear function to data that can’t be less than zero, because linear functions are convenient to work with. So we used a log link function to describe the mean and to ensure that the mean is always greater than zero.\nWe ended up with a model where the slope describes multiples of change in fish abundance over the pollution gradient. So the model itself is actually multiplicative, not additive.\nIf you think about it, natural processes that generate counts often are multiplicative, not additive. For instance, we may talk about ‘fish multiplying’ when they breed, because population growth can be exponential.\nSo our mathematically convenient link function actually ended up being a better description of the natural process.\nThe effort to use a non-negative model also forced us to think about using a more appropriate distribution for the data: the Poisson rather than the Normal. The Poisson has the variance increasing with the mean.\nOnce again, natural processes that generate counts often lead to increases in the variance in situations where we count more. Counts near zero will naturally have low variance, because they are constrained by zero, whereas higher counts will naturally have a greater variabilty.\nYou can also relax the assumption of mean = variance with other GLM distributions like the negative binomial.\nIt turns out that proper models of variance are crucial for getting the standard-errors right, and so crucial for detecting real effects over spurious ones.\nImagine if you used a Normal distribution and assumed equal variances. You might spuriously attribute differences between groups from high counts to some covariate, but the difference is actually just natural variation. Conversely, you might miss differences between groups with low counts, because a smaller difference at low counts should actually be statistically significant.\nThe increased power we get to detect differences at low counts with a GLM over a regression happens because it is the multiple of the difference that matters with the log link, not the absolute (additive) difference.\nMy final point is to remember that coefficients from a model with a log link (and some other links too, like the logit) are multiplicative. This can be very useful when it comes to making sense of your results and may change the way you present your findings.\nFor instance, we used this key insight from a GLM to make a case that pollution from logging causes a 24 times decline in the abundance of a threatened fish species.\nBefore we considered using the GLM, we had actually presented the results in terms of a % change in fish abundance. But % are not as easy to generalize, because they depend on your baseline. Multiples do not.\nHope you found this post helpful, and as always you can get me on Twitter if you have comments or questions.\n\n\nI wanted to add a brief appendix to address this question, because the answer is insightful as to how link functions work.\nTry take the data we generated above and fit two GLMs (you will have to add a small number so you can log the zeros, not ideal but a common practice)\nyobsplus &lt;- yobs_pois+0.1\nmodel1 &lt;- glm(yobsplus ~ x, family = gaussian(link = \"log\"))\nmodel2 &lt;- glm(log(yobsplus) ~ x, family = gaussian(link = \"identity\"))\nIn the first model we fitted a Gaussian (=Normal distributed errors) with a log link. In the second we fitted a Gaussian to log(y) with the identity link (which is no link).\nNow compare the results. Notice that the estimate of the slope is quite different. Why is this?\nThe model with the log link is fitting the mean on the log scale, the Gaussian errors will be on the natural scale. So the residual (or error) variance will be constant for all mean values of y.\nThe model with the log of the data and identity link is fitting the mean and variance on the log scale. So if we retransform log(y) back to y, the variance will change with the mean.\nSo a log link isn’t the same as a log transformation. The transformation changes the raw data. The link function doesn’t touch the raw data, instead you can think of it as a transformation of the model for the mean of the raw data."

    "text": "So now we come to link functions. Link functions elegantly solve the problem of using linear models with with non-normal data. There are many types of link functions, but we will look at one that is popular for use with count data.\nIf you wanted to stop a linear function from taking negative values what is one simple transformation you could make?\nWell, you could take the function’s exponent. We will redo the above linear equation as log-linear. I will change the parameter names to reflect that they are now logs:\ngamma &lt;- -3.2 #effect of polluted reefs\nalpha &lt;- 4 #intercept = mean at 'zero' pollution\nyexp &lt;- alpha*exp(gamma*x)\nplot(x, yexp, type = 'l', xlab = \"Pollution level\", ylab = \"Number of fish counted\")\nabline(h = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 2)\n\nHere we have the equation y = alpha *exp(gamma*x) which is the same as the linear equation for log(y): log(y) = log(alpha) +gamma*x. Note I have retained alpha=4 in both, because for both equations alpha is the expected value at pollution of zero.\nI changed the slope parameter in the log-linear equation to gamma because it is not a direct analogue of our slope parameter beta above.\nOne of the nice things about the log-linear equation is that the slope parameter now represents multiples of change. For instance, gamma = -3.2 means the abundance declines about 25 times decline (=1/exp(-3.2)) when going from a pollution level of 0 to 1.\nAbundance declines about a five times decline if we go from a pollution of 0 to 0.5 (= 1/exp(-3.2*0.5)). Noting this will be important when we come to interpreting fitted models below.\nWe could now use this exponential curve as the mean (and variance!) of a Poisson:\nyobs_pois &lt;- rpois(n, yexp)\nplot(x, yexp, type = 'l', xlab = \"Pollution level\",\n     ylab = \"Number of fish counted\",\n     ylim = c(0, 8))\npoints(x, yobs_pois)\n\nNotice that no data fall below zero now. Also, notice how the variance of the samples gets smaller as the mean gets smaller."

    "text": "In the real world, you will have the sample points, but not the ‘true’ mean. In the example above we just made up the true mean ourselves. In the real world Nature provides the ‘truth’ about how pollution impacts fish abundance and the best we can do is take as many measurements as we can and hope to get near the truth.\nTo estimate the effect of the pollution covariate you can use R’s glm() function:\nm1 &lt;- glm(yobs_pois ~ x, family = poisson(link = \"log\"))\ncoef(m1)\n\n## (Intercept)           x\n##    1.409704   -3.345646\nThe values we printed give the estimates for the intercept and slope coeffcients (alpha and gamma). You can check that these are similar to the true estimates we provided by comparing them to log(alpha) and gamma.\nI have specified above the type of distribution to use (family = poission()) and which link to use. \"log\" is in fact the default choice, but I put it there so you know you can change it.\nFor instance, you can use \"identity\" link for data that is far from zero. If you use the identity link, which is basically no link function, your model will be linear, not log-linear, so your slope estimate will once again be additive.\nTechnically we would say we fitted a Poisson Generalized Linear Model with a log link function. So the model’s predictions for the data will be Poisson distributed about its estimate for the mean. Note that the data can contain zeros, but the mean of the Poisson is always &gt;0.\nSo what do the coefficients mean? Remember the coefficients are on the log scale. So the mean abundance at a pollution level of zero = {r} exp(coef(m1)[1]) and a change in pollution from 0 to 1 causes an estimated {r} 1/exp(coef(m1)[2]) times decline in fish abundance.\nLet’s also plot the fitted model with standard errors.\nypredict &lt;- predict(m1, type = \"response\", se = TRUE)\nplot(x, yexp, type = 'l', xlab = \"Pollution level\",\n     ylab = \"Number of fish counted\",\n     ylim = c(0, 8))\nlines(x, ypredict$fit, lwd = 2, col = \"red\", lty = 2)\n#Add lines for standard errors\nlines(x, ypredict$fit + ypredict$se.fit, lty = 3, col = \"red\")\nlines(x, ypredict$fit - ypredict$se.fit, lty = 3, col = \"red\")\n#plot observations\npoints(x, yobs_pois)\nlegend('topright', legend = c(\"True mean\", \"Estimated mean\"),\n       lwd = 2, lty = c(1,2), col = c(\"black\", \"red\"))\n\nYou can see the fitted line falls close to the ‘true’ line, and the standard errors are pretty tight around our best estimate.\nThe fitting algorithm itself is attempting the maximise the log-likelihood of the observations given the mean (in technical speak). You can read more about likelihoods here.\nIt is also worth noting that we still need to do assumption checks, like we would for a regression with normal errors. For instance, we can check the model’s residuals (the difference between the data and the model’s predicted values) to see that the residual variance approximately equals the mean. A cool way to check assumptions of the Poisson model is to use ‘rootograms’, look it up."

    "text": "So in my introduction I claimed that maths of GLMs is beautiful. I think that because the maths is nicely coherent with the way nature often works.\nWe wanted to fit a linear function to data that can’t be less than zero, because linear functions are convenient to work with. So we used a log link function to describe the mean and to ensure that the mean is always greater than zero.\nWe ended up with a model where the slope describes multiples of change in fish abundance over the pollution gradient. So the model itself is actually multiplicative, not additive.\nIf you think about it, natural processes that generate counts often are multiplicative, not additive. For instance, we may talk about ‘fish multiplying’ when they breed, because population growth can be exponential.\nSo our mathematically convenient link function actually ended up being a better description of the natural process.\nThe effort to use a non-negative model also forced us to think about using a more appropriate distribution for the data: the Poisson rather than the Normal. The Poisson has the variance increasing with the mean.\nOnce again, natural processes that generate counts often lead to increases in the variance in situations where we count more. Counts near zero will naturally have low variance, because they are constrained by zero, whereas higher counts will naturally have a greater variabilty.\nYou can also relax the assumption of mean = variance with other GLM distributions like the negative binomial.\nIt turns out that proper models of variance are crucial for getting the standard-errors right, and so crucial for detecting real effects over spurious ones.\nImagine if you used a Normal distribution and assumed equal variances. You might spuriously attribute differences between groups from high counts to some covariate, but the difference is actually just natural variation. Conversely, you might miss differences between groups with low counts, because a smaller difference at low counts should actually be statistically significant.\nThe increased power we get to detect differences at low counts with a GLM over a regression happens because it is the multiple of the difference that matters with the log link, not the absolute (additive) difference.\nMy final point is to remember that coefficients from a model with a log link (and some other links too, like the logit) are multiplicative. This can be very useful when it comes to making sense of your results and may change the way you present your findings.\nFor instance, we used this key insight from a GLM to make a case that pollution from logging causes a 24 times decline in the abundance of a threatened fish species.\nBefore we considered using the GLM, we had actually presented the results in terms of a % change in fish abundance. But % are not as easy to generalize, because they depend on your baseline. Multiples do not.\nHope you found this post helpful, and as always you can get me on Twitter if you have comments or questions.\n\n\nI wanted to add a brief appendix to address this question, because the answer is insightful as to how link functions work.\nTry take the data we generated above and fit two GLMs (you will have to add a small number so you can log the zeros, not ideal but a common practice)\nyobsplus &lt;- yobs_pois+0.1\nmodel1 &lt;- glm(yobsplus ~ x, family = gaussian(link = \"log\"))\nmodel2 &lt;- glm(log(yobsplus) ~ x, family = gaussian(link = \"identity\"))\nIn the first model we fitted a Gaussian (=Normal distributed errors) with a log link. In the second we fitted a Gaussian to log(y) with the identity link (which is no link).\nNow compare the results. Notice that the estimate of the slope is quite different. Why is this?\nThe model with the log link is fitting the mean on the log scale, the Gaussian errors will be on the natural scale. So the residual (or error) variance will be constant for all mean values of y.\nThe model with the log of the data and identity link is fitting the mean and variance on the log scale. So if we retransform log(y) back to y, the variance will change with the mean.\nSo a log link isn’t the same as a log transformation. The transformation changes the raw data. The link function doesn’t touch the raw data, instead you can think of it as a transformation of the model for the mean of the raw data."

    "title": "Why we are all naturally Bayesians not frequentists",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I don’t see why its a thing to say “I’m a Bayesian”. Being a Bayesian is normal for any rational person as we will prove in a couple of sentences. Being a frequentist is what is what is strange. It would make more sense to assume we are all Bayesians, and have frequentists have to declare “I’m a frequentist”.\nThe statistical quantity of interest for frequentist is the likelihood, which is defined as the probability of your observations given your hypothesis. It can be written:\nPr(D | H)\n(Equivalently probability of data given we assume a particular model). For a Bayesian the statistical quantity is the probability of the hypothesis given the observations or:\nPr(H | D)\n(Equivalently probability of a model given the data).\nSay we’re out on a boat and we catch a glance of a human sized animal dive underwater with a flap of its tail. Was it a mermaid or a dugong? (A dugong is type of seagrass eating mammal).\nA frequentist would think in likelihoods and conclude, correctly, that both mermaid and dugong are equally likely: Both creatures, if assumed to exist, could result in a similar observation of us seeing a body and a tail diving underwater, i.e.\nPr(seeing a tail | dugongs exist) ≈ Pr(seeing a tail | mermaid exist)\nA rational person would guess the observed tail was a dugong. That is because a rational person is thinking in terms of probabilities. The probability we observed a mermaid is vanishingly small, because all prior evidence leads us to believe that mermaids don’t exist (though I do know some less than rational people who believe in ‘merfolk’).\nIn logic, Bayes theorem says we can calculate the probability of the hypothesis\nPr(H | D) = Pr(D | H)*Pr(H) / Pr(D)\nSo for the hypothesis “it’s a dugong”:\nPr(dugong | seeing tail) = Pr(seeing tail | dugong)*Pr(dugong) / Pr(seeing tail)\nFor our two models, dugong versus mermaid, we have similar values for the likelihoods and pr(D), but the ‘prior probabilities’, the Pr(H), are very different. Pr(dugong) is plausible (even though is rare to see them), whereas Pr(mermaid) is zero, because merfolk don’t exist.\nWe multiply the likelihood by the prior in the Bayes equation, so the Pr(mermaid | seeing tail) becomes zero.\n(If you are new to Bayes theory, you might be wondering what does Pr(D) mean? How do we calculate the probability of the data? For the above example it doesn’t matter as Pr(seeing a tail) is the same for both hypotheses. One of the challenges of Bayes stats in practice is calculating this Pr(D). A lot of statistical computing is devoted to figuring out how to do that. In brief though Pr(D) can be calculated as the sum of Pr(seeing tail | dugong)*Pr(H) for all discrete hypotheses or the integral if our hypotheses are continuous (like parameter values)).\nDoes this philosophical distinction it matter in the practice of statistics?\nThe Bayesian version of an analysis, such as a GLM, will often given similar or the same predictions as the frequentist version. Yet ecology, like many other disciplines, has a problem with repeatability and p-hacking.\nPart of the problem stems from the methods we use. For large sample sizes frequentist and Bayesian results often do converge.\nBut small sample sizes are common in many fields, including ecology. A small sample size study that finds an extreme and significant result is attractive to publish. This issue has been particularly problematic in behavioural ecology. These false positives come to dominate the literature.\nAppropriate use of Bayesian priors would penalize these extreme effect sizes. This is equivalent to setting a low probability on mermaid sightings above. Some have called for stronger priors to be the default choice\nSo in every day life we think of probabilities Bayesians, not like frequentists. There are numerous Bayesian R packages now and they are increasingly easy to use. So it makes sense that we should apply the same logic to our statistical analyses as well.\nThanks to Sober’s ‘Philosophy of Biology’ for this example (he uses gremlins in the roof rather than mermaids) and Coralina for telling me about the book!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Are we facing doomsday, or is the evidence spurious?\nThis recent article in The Guardian caught my eye (thanks to Euan Ritchie for posting it on twitter).\nThe authors argue that human society is approaching the limits of growth that our planet can sustain and we will soon be faced with the collapse of civilization as we know it.\nA group called the Club of Rome developed a very sophisticated model over 40 years ago. The model predicts global collapse in 2015-2030. Turner and Alexander argue that the the model has done a great job predicting the last 40 years, so we should be very concerned about what will happen in the next 15 years or so.\nWhile I am certainly concerned about environmental sustainability of human endeavours (they aren’t at a global scale!), I do not agree that the historical data presented in the new study is convincing evidence that this Club of Rome model’s predictions will unfold.\nWhy? Well the co-trending of data since 1970 and the model’s predictions could well be spurious.\nAs an aside I saw this excellent post on my same twitter feed. I recommend reading it, it’s an example of how human bias can lead to spurious findings.\nScroll down through The Guardian article or the author’s original report and you will see plots of several variables over time, as collated from global datasources and predicted by the 1970 model.\nThe variables include global population size, birth rate, death rate, among others, plotted on a ‘common scale’. The use of a ‘common scale (normalized values)’ is the first hint that something may be wrong. Often it is very hard to model actual values, but models can do a better job of predicting relative change. So we normalize model’s output to give a picture of relative change.\nPlotting ‘normalized’ model predictions and ‘normalized’ data can be misleading, because it gives the impression the model is predicting exactly what is happening. In reality it is only predicting the trend.\nThe second, bigger issue, relates to the reliability of predicting trends.\nThe key predictions of the 1970s model all revolve around a series of ‘turning points’: points in time where food production and services output suddenly drop and consequently birth rate drops, death rate increases and global population peaks then declines.\nWell none of the data show a drop yet. So the validation of the model is only done on increasing or decreasing trends. It is pretty easy to build a model that predicts a continuing trend and such correlations of trends over time are often spurious.\nThe real test of the model will be when the drop happens, or doesn’t.\nTo the authors credit they do spend some time looking at whether the processes underlying the model are likely to be realised, like peak oil. It is having plausible evidence for processes that distinguishes causation from correlation.\nHowever, the main argument for the 1970s model prediction of collapse is the historic comparison of model predictions to data.\nWe have learned a lot since the 1970s. There is still widespread belief among scientists that we are approaching global planetary boundaries, and some may have already been exceeded. However, it is not clear whether all of them have been reached yet and if they lead to the collapse of civilization. Not least because of the highly unpredictable role of technology in human change.\nSo while we should be concerned about doomsday scenarios, we should not give up hope for a better future on the basis of spurious correlations."

You can share them with others, or look up your old programs when a reviewer asks you months later to repeat that figure, but just include the outliers this time.3. R is relatively fast at performing analyses (compared to many GIS programs)4. You can combine state of the art statistics with great visualisations, including maps. Many leader’s in their fields develop packages for R, so if you can use R, you can get access to these pacakges.5. You can iterate repetitive tasks. This saves you time and means you can do things like model the distributions of 100s of species instead of just one, or make predictions at a global scale, instead of only local scales.  6.

    "text": "Spatial packages\n\n\nWe usually start a script by loading the neccessary packages with the library() function:\n\nlibrary(sp)\nlibrary(rgdal)\nlibrary(rgeos)\nlibrary(maptools)\n\nThese add-on packages contain everything we need for the first half of today. sp defines spatial objects and has a few functions for spatial data. rgdal is R’s interpretation of the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. It contains definitions and translations for projections for rasters and vectors (data types we will come to later), and is something like the babel fish for projections. rgeos is an open source geometry engine, and is used for manipulation of vector data. For instance, if we want know the land area of an island with lakes on it, rgeos will do the job. maptools has additional useful spatial tools. Take a moment and reflect how awesome it is that large teams of people have made all these packages open-source and that others have written packages to use them in R.\n\n\nMoving on. You will need to set your working directory to the folder where the datafiles for this course are: setwd(‘mypath/Datasets’) You can get the path by using your folder browser and right clicking and selecting properties, then just copy the path. Note on windows paths will be copied with &lt;/code&gt; rather than / so make sure you turn them around in your script."

    "text": "Exploring the dataframe\n\n\nThere are a few ways to extract specific variables or sites from the data frame. The \\(&lt;/code&gt; is used to indicate specific variables. Try typing &lt;code&gt;dat\\)s.gilbii. You can also call variables by their column numbers dat[,3] gets the third column. dat[5,] will give you all variables for the 5th site. We might also want to find out the number of sites, and having a nsites variable will be useful later on.\n\nnsites &lt;- nrow(dat)\nnsites\n\nWe might want to explore some summaries of the data too. For instance make a table of occurences of our two species\n\ntable(dat$s.gilbii, dat$s.stevenii)\n\nWe could do a simple plot of the sites by: plot(dat\\(x, dat\\)y). Another useful skill is subsetting dataframes, for instance, so we can just plot sites where S. gilbii occurs. We can do this using the which() function.\n\nisgilbi &lt;- which(dat$s.gilbii==1)\nisgilbi\n\nwhich() finds rows where s.gilbii equals 1 (note the double =, which means ‘does it equal 1’, rather than ‘make it equal 1’), which is where the species was recorded on the cameras. We could use our new variable of row numbers to plot the points where S. gilbii is present in red.\n\nplot(dat$x, dat$y)\npoints(dat$x[isgilbi], dat$y[isgilbi], col ='red')\n\nIf you are struggling to make sense of the which() command, don’t worry. Indexing is a basic programming skill, but it can take some time to get your head around. If you are looking for a book to help you can’t go past The Art of R Programming by Norman Matloff. It’s a great read and I read it cover to cover in almost a single sitting. Once you master simple programming tricks like indexing a whole new world of data manipulation and analysis (not just spatial!) will open up to you."

As I explained in the primer, nesting is a useful way to store this data. The following code might look complex, but it is really just a long string of nested commands. To get an overview of the nesting try\n\nstr(greenzones)\n\nWe can access the polygons for MPA 29 (the pink one) by typing\n\ngreenzones@polygons[[29]]@Polygons\n\nTry also\n\nstr(greenzones@polygons[[29]]@Polygons)\n\nMPA 29 is a bit unusual, in that it has two polygons. Why is this? Notice that there is a ‘hole’ slot within each polygon\n\ngreenzones@polygons[[29]]@Polygons[[1]]@hole\ngreenzones@polygons[[29]]@Polygons[[2]]@hole\n\nPolygon 1 has hole=F ALSE, polygon 2 has hole = TRUE. Have a look at the last map and see if you can figure out what the hole represents.\n\n\nYes indeed, it is an island. If we had a lake on the island with another island in that lake, we would have another polygon within the hole, with a hole in that! To get an idea of how polygon data are stored, you can extract the coordinates and just plot them (note, for type=‘l’ that is a letter ‘l’ for laugh, not the number ‘1’ or letter ‘i’)\n\nplot(greenzones@polygons[[29]]@Polygons[[1]]@coords, type='l', col='blue') #The MPA\nlines(greenzones@polygons[[29]]@Polygons[[2]]@coords, col='red') #The island in the MPA\n\nYou should see a blue box (the MPA) with a red island in it.\n\n\nYou might also notice there is an area slot for each polygon\n\ngreenzones@polygons[[23]]@area\n\nConvenient, but unfortunately it does not subtract the holes."

To use rgeos to calculate a polgyon’s area:\n\ngz.areas &lt;- gArea(greenzones, byid=TRUE)\n\nLet’s attach this more accurate area measurement to our spatial polgyons data frame, so we can plot it in spplot.

Writing loops is a very basic programming skill, but they can take some time to figure out initially. In this advanced task, we will use a loop to compare the rgeos area estimates with the areas in the ‘area’ slot. We can easily access the rgeos areas from the dataframe we made. However, the areas slot is hidden away deep in the polygon’s nested structure. We will use a loop to get the value for each polygon.First step, we have to make an empty variable to hold results. We can use rep() to do just replicate some NAs 33 times (33 is the number of MPAs).\n\npolyareas &lt;- rep(NA, nMPAs)\n\nThen follows our loop.\n\nfor (i in 1:nMPAs){\n  polyareas[i] &lt;- greenzones@polygons[[i]]@area\n}\n\nThis is a for loop. There are other types of loops too, but we will just look at for loops today. ‘For’ loops make a counting variable, in this case I called it i and they iterate the counter over multiple values, in this case from 1 to nMPAs. Try typing 1:nMPAs. These are the values i will take in each turn of the loop.The section in {} is where the looping actually happens. So for the first iteration i=1. We access polygon number 1 at its area slot. Then we assign it to polyareas[1]. The loop then steps to i=2 and repeats. And so on until i=33. Now look at polyareas. Before it was NAs, now it has the area numbers for each polygon, conveniently ordered in the same order as the polygons are stored. Our loop was pretty simple, but you can make them as complex as you like, including putting loops inside loops. We can compare the two area calculations to see where the areas slot is off and by how much it is off:\n\narea.diff &lt;- round(polyareas - gz.areas)\narea.diff\n\nCan you think of a way to plot the MPAs again, but this time with a different colour to warn us which ones have incorrect areas?"

With your own data, you will need to take more time to plan the workflow. Otherwise you can waste a lot of time and end up running down dead-ends, like eventually finding you have cropped a raster down too far. As an example of a simple workflow, let’s revist the tasks we just did, but with the specific aim of extracting river distances and seagrass presence at video sites in mind.So we have our sites data and we know it is in UTM coordinates: proj4String(datutm). We want to match our other layers to this layer. We might start a new script, and add comments as placeholders for tasks later, like this:\n\n# Script to extract seagrass and river distances for video sites\n# CJ Brown 27 Nov 2014\n### Outline\n#Load packages\n#Load points data\n# Load rivers and seagrass\n# Check projections for rivers and seagrass\n# Reproject rivers and seagrass if neccessary\n# Extract points\n# Add points to sites dataframe\n# Save new sites dataframe for analysis later\n\nThen we would start filling this in. For instance, assume you have read the data in already and are looking at rivers:\n\n#...\n#Check projection\nproj4string(r.riverdists)\n#It's not the correct UTM, reproject it\nr.riverutm &lt;- projectRaster(r.riverdists,r.sgutm)\n#Plot to check it looks right\nplot(r.riverutm, col =mycols)\n#Extract points\nsitedist &lt;- extract(r.riverutm, datutm)\n# And so on...\n\nPlanning like this can really help you save a lot of time by keeping you on track.\n\n\nFor Advanced users the dplyr package offers a cool function called pipes, which can make workflows easier to follow. Pipes look like this %&gt;% and basically take the output of one function and port it into the first argument of the next function. As an example, lets reproject rivers then extract site values in one line.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nsitedist &lt;- r.riverdists %&gt;% projectRaster(r.sgutm) %&gt;% extract(datutm)\n\nYou could read this code as: ’take r.riverdists, project it using the CRS of r.sgutm then extract the values at the coordinates of datutm."

I will explain more of these terms during the course.* AssignThe assign symbol &lt;- (AKA =) assigns a variable, like a number to a name like x. For instance to save the number one with the name x: x&lt;-1, which you can read as ‘assign x the number 1’.* ClassA class defines a structure for an object. That way, when I give some data and say it is of ‘raster’ class, you will know how it is structured and where to find different variables For instance, the extent.* ConsoleThe window where R code is executed.* FunctionA function takes some objects and changes them, returning a new object. For instance if we had a variable x of 20 numbers, we could calculate its mean using the mean() function like this mean(x). Some functions also have additional arguments. For instance, if we wanted to calculated the mean of ‘x’ removing missing values (coded as ‘NA’) we could write: mean(x, na.rm=T). Multiple arguments are separated by commas with a function’s brackets.* ListLists are nested objects of more objects.* ObjectAnything you store in R’s memory is an object. For instance, a string like this spatial a number like this 42 or even a new function. We will be working a lot with spatial objects today. See the entry for ‘lists’.* MethodA single function can have multiple methods, if it works with different classes of objects. For instance plot(x) works with many types of data including arrays of numbers, rasters, polygons and even model objects. See the entries for functions, objects and classes.* PackagesPackages are collections of functions that someone has written for distribution to others. The folder a package of functions is kept in is called its ‘library’, hence we load packages to an R session using the library() function.* ScriptA window with a text editor where we write code so we can save it for later. The code in your script won’t be exectued until you send it to the console (e.g. by clicking on a line and pressing Ctrl-R). The script should be written in the order you want the code to be executed. We’re not writing Pulp Fiction so keep your code in chronological order.* VariableI use this term loosely here, in general a variable is just a number or sequence of numbers you have saved in R’s memory.* Working directoryThe directory where R will look for any files you try to load. You can find out what it is by typing getwd() in the console. You can change it by typing setwd(’/Users/cbrown/Databases), where the path is the path I use for databases. You need to change it to your own."

    "title": "Checking residual distributions for non-normal GLMs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "If you are fitting a linear regression with Gaussian (normally distributed) errors, then one of the standard checks is to make sure the residuals are approximately normally distributed.\nIt is a good idea to do these checks for non-normal GLMs too, to make sure your residuals approximate the model’s assumption.\nHere I explain how to create quantile-quantile plots for non-normal data, using an example of fitting a GLM using Student-t distributed errors. Such models can be appropriate when the residuals are overdispersed.\nFirst let’s create some data. We will make a linear predictor (ie the true regression line) eta and then simulate some data by adding residuals. We will simulate two data-sets that have the same linear predictor, but the first will have normally distributed errors and the second will have t distributed errors:\nn &lt;- 100\nphi &lt;- 0.85\nmu &lt;- 0.5\nset.seed(23)\nx &lt;- rnorm(n)\n\neta &lt;- mu + phi * x\nnu &lt;- 2.5\ntau &lt;- 3\n\ny_tdist &lt;- eta + (rt(n, df=nu)/sqrt(tau))\ny_normdist &lt;- eta + rnorm(n, sd = 1/sqrt(tau))\n\nplot(x, y_tdist)\npoints(x, y_normdist, col = \"red\", pch = 16, cex = 0.8)\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend = c(\"t-distributed errors\", \"normally distributed errors\"), pch = c(1,16), col = c(\"black\", \"red\"))\n\nNotice how the t-distributed data are more spread out. The df parameter, here named nu=2.5 controls how dispersed the data are. Lower values will give data that are more dispersed, large values approach a normal distribution.\nNow let’s fit a Gaussian glm (just a linear regression really) to both these data-sets\nm1_norm &lt;- glm(y_normdist ~ x)\nm1_t &lt;-  glm(y_tdist ~ x)\nWe should check whether the two models meet the normal assumption, using the standard ‘qq’ (quantile-quantile) plot:\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(m1_norm, 2)\nplot(m1_t, 2)\n\nThese plots compare the theoretical quantiles to the actual quantiles of the residuals. If the points fall on the straight line then the theoretical and realised are very similar, and the assumption is met. Clearly this is not the case for the second model, which is overdispersed.\nWe know it is overdispersed because the theoretical quantiles are much smaller than the actual at the tails (notice how the ends down then up).\nThe p-values (or CIs if you use them) for m1_t are therefore likely biased and too narrow, leading potentially to type I errors (us saying that x affects y, which in fact it does not). In this case we know we haven’t made a type I error, because we made up the data. However, if you were using real data you wouldn’t be so sure.\n\n\n\nTo better understand the QQ plot it helps to generate it yourself, rather than using R’s automatic checks.\nFirst we calculate the model residuals (in plot(m1_t) R did this internally):\nm1_t_resid &lt;- y_tdist - predict(m1_t)\nThen we can plot the quantiles for the residuals against theoretical quantiles generated using qnorm. Below we also plot the original QQ plot from above, so you can see that our version is the same as R’s automatic one:\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nqqplot(qnorm(ppoints(n), sd = 1), m1_t_resid)\nqqline(m1_t_resid, lty = 2)\n\nplot(m1_t,2)\n\nI added the qqline for comparative purposes. It just puts a line through the 25th and 75th quantiles.\n\n\n\nNow we have learned how to write our own custom for a QQ plot, we can use it to check other types of non-normal data.\nHere we will fit a GLM to the y_tdist data using student-t distributed errors. I do this using the Bayesian package INLA.\nlibrary(INLA)\n\ndata &lt;- list(y=y_tdist, x = x)\nmod_tdist &lt;- inla(y ~ x, family=\"T\", data=data,\n    control.predictor = list(compute = TRUE),\n    control.family =\n        list(\n            hyper =\n                list(prec = list(prior=\"loggamma\",param=c(1,0.5)),\n                    dof = list(prior=\"loggamma\",param=c(1,0.5))\n                    )\n            )\n        )\nThe family =\"T\" command tells INLA to use the t-distribution, rather than the Normal distribution. Note also I have specified the priors using the control.family command. This is best practice. We need a prior for the precision (1/variance) and a prior for the dof (= degrees of freedom, which has to be &gt;2 in INLA).\nIt is sometimes help to visualise the priors, so we can check too see they look sensible. Here we visualise the prior for the dof, (which in INLA has a min value of 2):\nxgamma &lt;- seq(0.01, 10, length.out = 100)\nplot(xgamma+2, dgamma(xgamma, 1, 0.5), type = 'l', xlab = \"Quantile\", ylab = \"Density\")\n\nWe don’t really expect values much greater than 10, so this prior makes sense. If we used an old-school prior that was flat in 2-1000 we might get issues with model fitting.\nNow enough about priors. Let’s look at the estimated coefficients:\nmod_tdist$summary.fixed\n\n##                  mean         sd 0.025quant  0.5quant 0.975quant      mode\n## (Intercept) 0.5324814 0.07927198  0.3773399 0.5321649  0.6891779 0.5315490\n## x           0.7229362 0.08301006  0.5565746 0.7239544  0.8835630 0.7259817\n##                      kld\n## (Intercept) 3.067485e-12\n## x           6.557565e-12\nGood the CIs contain our true values, and the mean is close to our true value too. What about the hyper-parameters (the precision and DF)? We need to get INLA to run some more calucations to get accurate estimates of these:\nh_tdist &lt;- inla.hyperpar(mod_tdist)\nh_tdist$summary.hyperpar[,3:5]\n\n##                                          0.025quant  0.5quant 0.975quant\n## precision for the student-t observations  0.2663364 0.6293265   1.163440\n## degrees of freedom for student-t          2.2404966 2.7396391   4.459057\nThe estimate for the DF might be a ways off the mark. That is ok, we expect that, you need lots of really good data to get accurate estimates of hyper-parameters.\nNow, let’s use our skills in creating QQ plots to make QQ plot using theoretical quantiles from the t distribution.\nFirst step is to extract INLA’s predictions of the data, so we can calculate residuals\npreds &lt;- mod_tdist$summary.fitted.values\nresids &lt;- y_tdist - preds[,4]\nNext step is to extract the marginal estimates of the DF and precision to use when generating our QQ plot (the quantiles will change with the DF):\ntau_est &lt;- h_tdist$summary.hyperpar[1,4]\nnu_est &lt;- h_tdist$summary.hyperpar[2,4]\nNow we can use qt() to generate theoretical quantiles and the residuals for our realised quantiles:\nqqplot(qt(ppoints(n), df = nu_est), resids * sqrt(tau_est),\n    xlab = \"Theoretical quantile\", ylab = \"residuals\")\nqqline(resids * sqrt(tau_est), lty = 2)\n\nNote that I multiply the residuals by the sqrt of the precision estimate. This is how INLA fits a t-distributed GLM. I do the same for the qqline.\nOur residuals are now falling much closer to the line. The model is doing a much better job of fitting the data. You could also calculate the WAIC for this model and a Gaussian one, to compare the fits. The t-distributed GLM should have a lower WAIC (better fit).\nWe can now be confident that our CIs are accurate."

    "text": "If you are fitting a linear regression with Gaussian (normally distributed) errors, then one of the standard checks is to make sure the residuals are approximately normally distributed.\nIt is a good idea to do these checks for non-normal GLMs too, to make sure your residuals approximate the model’s assumption.\nHere I explain how to create quantile-quantile plots for non-normal data, using an example of fitting a GLM using Student-t distributed errors. Such models can be appropriate when the residuals are overdispersed.\nFirst let’s create some data. We will make a linear predictor (ie the true regression line) eta and then simulate some data by adding residuals. We will simulate two data-sets that have the same linear predictor, but the first will have normally distributed errors and the second will have t distributed errors:\nn &lt;- 100\nphi &lt;- 0.85\nmu &lt;- 0.5\nset.seed(23)\nx &lt;- rnorm(n)\n\neta &lt;- mu + phi * x\nnu &lt;- 2.5\ntau &lt;- 3\n\ny_tdist &lt;- eta + (rt(n, df=nu)/sqrt(tau))\ny_normdist &lt;- eta + rnorm(n, sd = 1/sqrt(tau))\n\nplot(x, y_tdist)\npoints(x, y_normdist, col = \"red\", pch = 16, cex = 0.8)\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend = c(\"t-distributed errors\", \"normally distributed errors\"), pch = c(1,16), col = c(\"black\", \"red\"))\n\nNotice how the t-distributed data are more spread out. The df parameter, here named nu=2.5 controls how dispersed the data are. Lower values will give data that are more dispersed, large values approach a normal distribution.\nNow let’s fit a Gaussian glm (just a linear regression really) to both these data-sets\nm1_norm &lt;- glm(y_normdist ~ x)\nm1_t &lt;-  glm(y_tdist ~ x)\nWe should check whether the two models meet the normal assumption, using the standard ‘qq’ (quantile-quantile) plot:\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(m1_norm, 2)\nplot(m1_t, 2)\n\nThese plots compare the theoretical quantiles to the actual quantiles of the residuals. If the points fall on the straight line then the theoretical and realised are very similar, and the assumption is met. Clearly this is not the case for the second model, which is overdispersed.\nWe know it is overdispersed because the theoretical quantiles are much smaller than the actual at the tails (notice how the ends down then up).\nThe p-values (or CIs if you use them) for m1_t are therefore likely biased and too narrow, leading potentially to type I errors (us saying that x affects y, which in fact it does not). In this case we know we haven’t made a type I error, because we made up the data. However, if you were using real data you wouldn’t be so sure."

Below we also plot the original QQ plot from above, so you can see that our version is the same as R’s automatic one:\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nqqplot(qnorm(ppoints(n), sd = 1), m1_t_resid)\nqqline(m1_t_resid, lty = 2)\n\nplot(m1_t,2)\n\nI added the qqline for comparative purposes.

    "text": "Now we have learned how to write our own custom for a QQ plot, we can use it to check other types of non-normal data.\nHere we will fit a GLM to the y_tdist data using student-t distributed errors. I do this using the Bayesian package INLA.\nlibrary(INLA)\n\ndata &lt;- list(y=y_tdist, x = x)\nmod_tdist &lt;- inla(y ~ x, family=\"T\", data=data,\n    control.predictor = list(compute = TRUE),\n    control.family =\n        list(\n            hyper =\n                list(prec = list(prior=\"loggamma\",param=c(1,0.5)),\n                    dof = list(prior=\"loggamma\",param=c(1,0.5))\n                    )\n            )\n        )\nThe family =\"T\" command tells INLA to use the t-distribution, rather than the Normal distribution. Note also I have specified the priors using the control.family command. This is best practice. We need a prior for the precision (1/variance) and a prior for the dof (= degrees of freedom, which has to be &gt;2 in INLA).\nIt is sometimes help to visualise the priors, so we can check too see they look sensible. Here we visualise the prior for the dof, (which in INLA has a min value of 2):\nxgamma &lt;- seq(0.01, 10, length.out = 100)\nplot(xgamma+2, dgamma(xgamma, 1, 0.5), type = 'l', xlab = \"Quantile\", ylab = \"Density\")\n\nWe don’t really expect values much greater than 10, so this prior makes sense. If we used an old-school prior that was flat in 2-1000 we might get issues with model fitting.\nNow enough about priors. Let’s look at the estimated coefficients:\nmod_tdist$summary.fixed\n\n##                  mean         sd 0.025quant  0.5quant 0.975quant      mode\n## (Intercept) 0.5324814 0.07927198  0.3773399 0.5321649  0.6891779 0.5315490\n## x           0.7229362 0.08301006  0.5565746 0.7239544  0.8835630 0.7259817\n##                      kld\n## (Intercept) 3.067485e-12\n## x           6.557565e-12\nGood the CIs contain our true values, and the mean is close to our true value too. What about the hyper-parameters (the precision and DF)? We need to get INLA to run some more calucations to get accurate estimates of these:\nh_tdist &lt;- inla.hyperpar(mod_tdist)\nh_tdist$summary.hyperpar[,3:5]\n\n##                                          0.025quant  0.5quant 0.975quant\n## precision for the student-t observations  0.2663364 0.6293265   1.163440\n## degrees of freedom for student-t          2.2404966 2.7396391   4.459057\nThe estimate for the DF might be a ways off the mark. That is ok, we expect that, you need lots of really good data to get accurate estimates of hyper-parameters.\nNow, let’s use our skills in creating QQ plots to make QQ plot using theoretical quantiles from the t distribution.\nFirst step is to extract INLA’s predictions of the data, so we can calculate residuals\npreds &lt;- mod_tdist$summary.fitted.values\nresids &lt;- y_tdist - preds[,4]\nNext step is to extract the marginal estimates of the DF and precision to use when generating our QQ plot (the quantiles will change with the DF):\ntau_est &lt;- h_tdist$summary.hyperpar[1,4]\nnu_est &lt;- h_tdist$summary.hyperpar[2,4]\nNow we can use qt() to generate theoretical quantiles and the residuals for our realised quantiles:\nqqplot(qt(ppoints(n), df = nu_est), resids * sqrt(tau_est),\n    xlab = \"Theoretical quantile\", ylab = \"residuals\")\nqqline(resids * sqrt(tau_est), lty = 2)\n\nNote that I multiply the residuals by the sqrt of the precision estimate. This is how INLA fits a t-distributed GLM. I do the same for the qqline.\nOur residuals are now falling much closer to the line. The model is doing a much better job of fitting the data. You could also calculate the WAIC for this model and a Gaussian one, to compare the fits. The t-distributed GLM should have a lower WAIC (better fit).\nWe can now be confident that our CIs are accurate."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Are more marine protected areas needed to protect ocean biodiversity?\nMarine protected areas are a primary tool for conserving marine ecosystems, habitats and species. For instance, the Convention on Biological Diversity, has 193 signatory nations committing to protecting more than 10% of marine environments by 2020. We have recently shown that there are a large number of species that are not protected or inadequately protected in the global protected area system. These ‘gaps’ will be challenging to fill by 2020.\n\n\n\nDensity map of species not receiving any protection from protected areas, according to our recent analysis \n\n\nNew marine reserves are always contentious. Marine reserves are areas closed to fishing to protect native plants and animals, so protection often comes at a cost to local fishing industries who will be excluded from fishing in some places. For instance, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Protected Area was rezoned in 2004 to have 33.3% of its area as no fishing zones. The process was highly contentious and cost the Federal Government ~$250 million in compensation pay-outs to fisheries. Clearly, balancing the needs of conservation with its impacts on fisheries is important for both people and economies.\n\n\n\nConserving ecosystems, like this coral reef, sustaining productive fisheries and restoring depleted fisheries are all potentially competing objectives.\n\n\nOur recently analysis makes a start at quantifying the shortfall in conservation, but does not consider the cost of meeting that shortfall for economies, society and industries, such as fisheries. Balancing multiple ecological and societal objectives is tricky. Doing it properly requires government and stakeholders to be clear about the objectives of management and then applying the right management tools to achieve those objectives.\nMarine protected areas are one tool for balanced management, but not the only tool. In many cases, sustainable management of fisheries may do a better job at both protecting ecosystems, while still allowing profitable fisheries to operate. The reason being that marine reserves on their own (without buy-backs to reduce the number of boats) squeeze fishers into a smaller operating space, and thus, can actually increase the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems.\nIn some cases marine protected areas will be the best tool balancing ecosystem objectives with fisheries. For instance, they may often be easier to enforce than catch limits. Hence their popularity as a management tool in many community based initiatives.\nClearly marine ecosystems are under-protected globally. But in meeting the shortfall we need to be careful that we choose the right tools and consider the costs of conservation to people. In choosing the right tools, we can help to avoid contentious debates on protection. In the long-run protecting ecosystems is not only good for biodiversity, but it can help sustain fisheries too.\nFurther reading\nGet the pdf\nBrown CJ, Mumby PJ.

    "title": "Three ways to calculate distances in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Calculating a distance on a map sounds straightforward, but it can be confusing how many different ways there are to do this in R.\nThis complexity arises because there are different ways of defining ‘distance’ on the Earth’s surface.\nThe Earth is spherical. So do you want to calculate distances around the sphere (‘great circle distances’) or distances on a map (‘Euclidean distances’).\nThen there are barriers. For example, for distances in the ocean, we often want to know the nearest distance around islands.\nThen there is the added complexity of the different spatial data types. Here we will just look at points, but these same concepts apply to other data types, like shapes.\n\n\nLet’s look at some example data. It is just a series of points across the island of Tasmania. We are going to calculate how far apart these points are from each other.\nWe’ll use sf for spatial data and tmap for mapping.\nHere’s a map:\ntm_shape(stas) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_graticules(col = \"grey60\") +\n  tm_shape(pts) +\n  tm_symbols(col = \"black\") +\n  tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_shape(pts) +\n  tm_text(\"pt\", ymod = -1)\n\nNote I’ve included a scale bar, but of course the distance between longitude lines gets closer at higher latitudes.\n\n\n\nThe first method is to calculate great circle distances, that account for the curvature of the earth. If we use st_distance() with unprojected coordinates (ie in lon-lat) then we get great circle distances (in metres).\nm &lt;- st_distance(pts)\nm/1000\n\n## Units: [m]\n##          [,1]     [,2]      [,3]\n## [1,]    0.000 821.5470 1200.7406\n## [2,]  821.547   0.0000  419.5004\n## [3,] 1200.741 419.5004    0.0000\nThe matrix m gives the distances between points (we divided by 1000 to get distances in KM).\n\n\n\nAnother option is to first project the points to a projection that preserves distances and then calculate the distances. This option is computationally faster, but can be less accurate, as we will see.\nWe will use the local UTM projection. So you can see what this looks like, we will project the land too.\ntas_utm &lt;- st_crs(\"+proj=utm +zone=55 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs\")\nstas2 &lt;- st_transform(stas, crs = tas_utm)\npts2 &lt;- st_transform(pts, crs = tas_utm)\n\ntm_shape(stas2) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_graticules(col = \"grey60\") +\n  tm_shape(pts2) +\n  tm_symbols(col = \"black\") +\n  tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_shape(pts) +\n  tm_text(\"pt\", ymod = -1)\n\nNote how it now bends the lat/long lines. This happens because we are projecting a sphere onto a flat surface. The UTM will be most accurate at the centre of its zone (we used Zone 55 which is approximately centred on Tasmania).\nIf we were interested in mapping the mainland of Australia accurately, we’d use a different UTM zone.\nNow we can calculate Euclidean distances:\nm2 &lt;- st_distance(pts2)\nm2/1000\n\n## Units: [m]\n##           [,1]     [,2]      [,3]\n## [1,]    0.0000 824.8996 1203.6228\n## [2,]  824.8996   0.0000  419.4163\n## [3,] 1203.6228 419.4163    0.0000\nCompare these to our great circle distances:\nm/1000\n\n## Units: [m]\n##          [,1]     [,2]      [,3]\n## [1,]    0.000 821.5470 1200.7406\n## [2,]  821.547   0.0000  419.5004\n## [3,] 1200.741 419.5004    0.0000\nNote the slight differences, particularly between point 1 and the other points. The first method (great circle) is the more accurate one, but is also a bit slower. The Euclidean distances become a bit inaccurate for point 1, because it is so far outside the zone of the UTM projection.\nPoints 2 & 3 are within the UTM zone, so the distance between these points is almost identical to the great circle calculation.\n\n\n\nThe basic idea here is that we turn the data into a raster grid and then use the gridDistance() function to calculate distances around barriers (land) between points.\nSo first we need to rasterize the land. The package fasterize has a fast way to turn sf polygons into land:\nlibrary(fasterize)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nr &lt;- raster(extent(stas2), nrows = 50, ncols = 50)\nrtas &lt;- fasterize(summarize(stas2), r)\nI made the raster pretty blocky (50 x 50). You could increase the resolution to improve the accuracy of the distance measurements. Here’s how it looks:\n\nNow we need to identify the raster cell’s where the points fall. We do this by extracting coordinates from pts2 and asking for their unique raster cell numbers:\nrtas_pts &lt;- rtas\nxy &lt;- st_coordinates(pts2)\nicell &lt;- cellFromXY(rtas, xy)\nNow, we set the cells of our raster corresponding to the points to a different number than the rest. I will just use the 3rd point (if we used all points then we get nearest distance around barriers to any point).\nrtas_pts[icell[3]] &lt;- 2\nThis will look like the same raster, but with a spot where the 3rd point fell (note red box):\n\nNow just run gridDistance telling it to calculate distances from the cells with a value of 2 (just one cell in this case) and omit values of 1 (land) when doing the distances:\nd &lt;- gridDistance(rtas_pts, origin = 2,\n                  omit = 1)/1000\nThis will be slow for larger rasters (or very high res). Let’s see how it looks:\n\nColours correspond to distances from point 3 (the location we gave a value of ‘2’ to in the raster).\nNow we can just ask for the distance values at the cells of the other points:\nd[icell]\n\n## [1] 1310.5141  612.1404    0.0000\nSo 612 km around Tasmania from point 3 to 2, as the dolphin swims. It was only 419 km if we could fly straight over Tasmania:\nm[2,3]/1000\n\n## 419.5004 [m]\n(note is says metres, but that is because R hasn’t remembered we’ve divided by 1000)"

The UTM will be most accurate at the centre of its zone (we used Zone 55 which is approximately centred on Tasmania).\nIf we were interested in mapping the mainland of Australia accurately, we’d use a different UTM zone.\nNow we can calculate Euclidean distances:\nm2 &lt;- st_distance(pts2)\nm2/1000\n\n## Units: [m]\n##           [,1]     [,2]      [,3]\n## [1,]    0.0000 824.8996 1203.6228\n## [2,]  824.8996   0.0000  419.4163\n## [3,] 1203.6228 419.4163    0.0000\nCompare these to our great circle distances:\nm/1000\n\n## Units: [m]\n##          [,1]     [,2]      [,3]\n## [1,]    0.000 821.5470 1200.7406\n## [2,]  821.547   0.0000  419.5004\n## [3,] 1200.741 419.5004    0.0000\nNote the slight differences, particularly between point 1 and the other points. The first method (great circle) is the more accurate one, but is also a bit slower. The Euclidean distances become a bit inaccurate for point 1, because it is so far outside the zone of the UTM projection.\nPoints 2 & 3 are within the UTM zone, so the distance between these points is almost identical to the great circle calculation."

    "text": "The basic idea here is that we turn the data into a raster grid and then use the gridDistance() function to calculate distances around barriers (land) between points.\nSo first we need to rasterize the land. The package fasterize has a fast way to turn sf polygons into land:\nlibrary(fasterize)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nr &lt;- raster(extent(stas2), nrows = 50, ncols = 50)\nrtas &lt;- fasterize(summarize(stas2), r)\nI made the raster pretty blocky (50 x 50). You could increase the resolution to improve the accuracy of the distance measurements. Here’s how it looks:\n\nNow we need to identify the raster cell’s where the points fall. We do this by extracting coordinates from pts2 and asking for their unique raster cell numbers:\nrtas_pts &lt;- rtas\nxy &lt;- st_coordinates(pts2)\nicell &lt;- cellFromXY(rtas, xy)\nNow, we set the cells of our raster corresponding to the points to a different number than the rest. I will just use the 3rd point (if we used all points then we get nearest distance around barriers to any point).\nrtas_pts[icell[3]] &lt;- 2\nThis will look like the same raster, but with a spot where the 3rd point fell (note red box):\n\nNow just run gridDistance telling it to calculate distances from the cells with a value of 2 (just one cell in this case) and omit values of 1 (land) when doing the distances:\nd &lt;- gridDistance(rtas_pts, origin = 2,\n                  omit = 1)/1000\nThis will be slow for larger rasters (or very high res). Let’s see how it looks:\n\nColours correspond to distances from point 3 (the location we gave a value of ‘2’ to in the raster).\nNow we can just ask for the distance values at the cells of the other points:\nd[icell]\n\n## [1] 1310.5141  612.1404    0.0000\nSo 612 km around Tasmania from point 3 to 2, as the dolphin swims. It was only 419 km if we could fly straight over Tasmania:\nm[2,3]/1000\n\n## 419.5004 [m]\n(note is says metres, but that is because R hasn’t remembered we’ve divided by 1000)"

However, the problem is that parks don’t protect fish outside their boundaries.”\n\n\n“In fact, extensive parks can actually concentrate fishing in outside areas.”\n\n\nDr Brown’s research shows that bag limits are just as important for healthy ecosystems because they apply everywhere and thus help protect the health of ecosystems outside park boundaries.\n\n\n“The right combination of bag limits and parks can ensure we have healthy ecosystems and fish to catch,” says Dr Brown.\n\n\n“In other words, ecosystems can have their fish, and we can eat them too.”\n\n\nMore details on the research:\n\n\nTrade-offs between fisheries and the conservation of ecosystem function are defined by management strategy (2014) Brown, Mumby Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment"

    "text": "Example: Clean pdfs text and summarize\nNow let’s see if we can use ellmer to clean up some text from a pdf and summarize it. ellmer has some handy functions for processing pdfs to text, so they can then be fed into prompts.\nI’m going to attempt to summarize my recent paper on turtle fishing.\nx &lt;- content_pdf_url(\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/conl.13056\")\nThis fails with a 403 error. This means the server is blocking the request, it probably guesses (correctly) that I’m calling the pdf programmatically: it thinks I’m a bot (which this tutorial kind of is creating).\nWe can also try with a file on our hard drive, we just have to manually download the pdf.\nmypdf &lt;- content_pdf_file(\"pdf-examples/Brown_etal2024 national scale turtle mortality.pdf\")\nThat works, now let’s use it within a chat. First set-up our chat:\nchat &lt;- chat_claude(\n  system_prompt = \"You are a research assistant who specializes in extracting structured data from scientific papers.\",\n  model = \"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022\", \n  max_tokens = 1000\n)\n\nNow, we can use ellmer’s functions for specifying structured data. Many LLMs can be used to generate data in the JSON format (they were specifically trained with that in mind).\nellmer handles the conversion from JSON to R objects that are easier for us R users to understand.\nYou use the type_object then type_number, type_string etc.. to specify the types of data. Read more in the ellmer package vignettes\npaper_stats &lt;- type_object(\n  sample_size = type_number(\"Sample size of the study\"),\n  year_of_study = type_number(\"Year data was collected\"),\n  method = type_string(\"Summary of statistical method, one paragraph max\")\n)\n\nFinally, we send the request for a summary to the provider:\nturtle_study &lt;- chat$extract_data(mypdf, type = paper_stats)\nThe turtle_study object will contain the structured data from the pdf. I think (the ellmer documentation is a bit sparse on implementation details) ellmer is converting a JSON that comes from the LLM to a friendly R list.\nclass(turtle_study)\n#list\nAnd:\nturtle_study$sample_size\n#11935\nturtle_study$year_of_study\n#2018\nturtle_study$method\n#The study estimated national-scale turtle catches for two fisheries in the Solomon Islands \n#- a small-scale reef fishery and a tuna longline fishery - using community surveys and \n#electronic monitoring. The researchers used nonparametric bootstrapping to scale up \n#catch data and calculate national-level estimates with confidence intervals.\nIt works, but like any structured lit review you need to be careful what questions you ask. Even more so with an LLM as you are not reading the paper and understanding the context.\nIn this case the sample size its given us is the estimated number of turtles caught. This was a model output, not a sample size. In fact this paper has several methods with different sample sizes. So some work would be needed to fine-tune the prompt, especially if you are batch processing many papers.\nYou should also experiment with models, I used Claude haiku because its cheap, but Claude sonnet would probably be more accurate."

The first is from another study on turtle catch in Madagascar. The second is from my study above.\nWhat we’ll do is create a function that reads in the text, then passes it to the LLM, using the request for structured data from above.\n  process_abstract &lt;- function(file_path, chat) {\n  # Read in the text file\n  abstract_text &lt;- readLines(file_path, warn = FALSE)\n  \n  # Extract data from the abstract\n  result &lt;- chat$extract_data(abstract_text, type = paper_stats)\n  \n  return(result)\n}\nNow set-up our chat and data request\n# Create chat object if not already created\nchat &lt;- chat_claude(\n      system_prompt = \"You are a research assistant who specializes in extracting structured data from scientific papers.\",\n      model = \"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022\", \n      max_tokens = 1000\n)\nThere’s a risk that the LLM will hallucinate data if it can’t find an answer. To try to prevent this we can set an option , required = FALSE. Then the LLM should return ‘NULL’ if it can’t find the data.\n# Define the structured data format\npaper_stats &lt;- type_object(\n    sample_size = type_number(\"Number of surveys conducted to estimate turtle catch\", required = FALSE),\n    turtles_caught = type_number(\"Estimate for number of turtles caught\", required = FALSE),\n    year_of_study = type_number(\"Year data was collected\", required = FALSE),\n    region = type_string(\"Country or geographic region of the study\", required = FALSE)\n  )\nNow we can batch process the abstracts and get the structured data\n\nabstract_files &lt;- list.files(path = \"pdf-examples\", pattern = \"\\\\.txt$\", full.names = TRUE)\nresults &lt;- lapply(abstract_files, function(file) process_abstract(file, chat))\nnames(results) &lt;- basename(abstract_files)\n\n# Display results\nprint(results)\nIn my first take without the required = FALSE I got some fake results. It hallucinated that the Humber study was conducted in 2023 (it was published in 2010!) and that there were 2 villages surveyed in my study. The problem was that you can’t get that data from the abstracts. So the model is hallucinating a response.\nUnfortunately, with required = FALSE it still hallucinated answers. I then tried Claude sonnet (a more powerful reasoning model) and it correctly put NULL for my study’s sample size, but still got the year wrong for the Humber study.\nI think this could work, but some work on the prompts would be needed."

    "section": "Reflections",
    "text": "Reflections\nThe ellmer package solves some of the challenges I outlined in my last blog on LLM access from R. But others are deeper conceptual challengs and remain. I’ll repeat those here\n\nCost uncertainty\nThis should be cheap. It cost &lt;1c to make this post with all the testing. So in theory you could do 100s of methods sections for &lt;100USD. However, if you are testing back and forwards a lot or using full papers the cost could add up. It will be hard to estimate this until people get more experience.\n\n\nObtaining the papers and dealing with unstructued text in PDFs or HTML\nA big challenge will be getting the text into a format that the LLM can use. Then there are issues like obtaining the text. Downloading pdfs is time consuming and data intensive. Trying to read text data from webpages can also be hard, due to paywalls and rate limits (you might get blocked for making reqeat requests).\nFor instance, in a past study we did where we did simple ‘bag of words analysis’ we either downloaded the pdfs manually, or set timers to delay web hits and avoid getting blocked.\nHTML format would be ideal, because the tags mean the sections of the paper, and the figures already semi-structured.\nThe ellmer pdf utility function seems to work ok for getting text from pdfs. I’m guessing it could be improved though, e.g. to remove wastefull (=$) text like page headers.\n\n\nPrompting\nNeed to experiment with this to get it right. It might also be good to repeat prompt the same text to triangulate accurate results.\n\n\nValidation\nYou’ll definitely want to manually check the output and report accuracy statistics in your study. So maybe your review has 1000 papers, you’ll want to manually check 100 of them to see how accurate the LLM was.\n\n\nYou’ll still need to read a lot of papers to write a good lit review\nA lit review is more than the systematic data. I still believe you need to read a lot of papers in order to understand the literature and make a useful synthesis. If you just use AI you’re vulnerable to the ‘illusion of understanding’.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis tool will be best for well defined tasks and consistently written papers. For instance, an ideal use case would be reviewing 500 ocean acidification papers that all used similar experimental designs and terminology. You’ll then be able to get consistent answers to prompts about sample size etc…\nAnother good use case would be to extract model types from species distribution model papers.\nHarder tasks will be where the papers are from diverse disciplines, or use inconsistent terminology, or methods. My study was a good example of that, there were about 5 different sample sizes reported. So in this example we’d need first to think clearly about what sample size you wanted to extract before writing the prompt."

More on this later.\nThe other day I was browsing Wickhams Advanced R book and realised it is actually pretty easy to write basic C++ loops.\nThen I wondered if it would still be faster if you had to make repeated calls to the same C++ function, for instance if you wanted to run a sensitivity analysis, varying some model parameters. I like to use R for this task because the purrr package makes it incredibly easy to run arbitrary combinations of parameters through a function. Then it is straightforward to summarize and plot the results with ggplot2.\nTurns out you can get a massive improvement, even for repeated calls to the same function. Here is a test.\n\n\nFirst up, let’s write a simple model for simulating population size over time, according to the logistic function. The below function just takes your standard r (intrinsic population growth) and k (carrying capacity) parameters and simulates population size starting at yinit over t years.\nFurther, to I have included a stochastic process, whose variation is controlled by thetasd, to illustrate Rcpp random number generator.\nlogmodr &lt;- function(t, yinit, r, k, thetasd){\n    y &lt;- numeric(t)\n    y[1] &lt;- yinit\n    theta &lt;- rnorm(t, 0, thetasd)\n    for(i in 2:t){\n        y[i] &lt;- y[i-1]*(r - r*(y[i-1]/k)) * exp(theta[i])\n    }\n    return(y)\n}\nNote that I also ran these models without the stochastic component. The speedup was even greater when you compared C++ to R without the stochastic step (about 20 times).\n\n\n\nNow let’s write the equivalent C++ function. You will need to install the Rcpp package. Note that it has some other software dependencies, so I recommend you read the guide on CRAN.\nWe write the function definition as a string and pass it to cppFunction from Rcpp:\nlibrary(Rcpp)\n    cppFunction(\"NumericVector logmodc(int t, double yinit, double r,\ndouble k, double thetasd){\n            NumericVector y(t);\n            y[0] = yinit;\n      NumericVector theta = rnorm(t, 0, thetasd);\n            for (int i = 1; i &lt; t; ++i){\n                y[i] = y[i-1]*(r - r*(y[i-1] / k)) * exp(theta[i]);\n                }\n            return y;\n    }\n    \")\nHopefully you can understand this, even if you are not familiar with C++. The syntax is reasonably similar to R. If you learned to program in R you may notice a few discrepencies.\nFirst, C++ requires that you specify the type of each variable when its created. You can’t just create new variables without assigning them a type, and you can’t just change the type. This makes C++ more efficient than R, because the computer knows exactly how much memory to allocate a variable and doesn’t have to watch for changes.\nSecond, notice I start the iterator at time-step 1, whereas in the R code we started at time-step 2. In C++ vectors are indexed starting at 0.\nFinally, don’t forget to end lines with ; (you can use ; to end lines in R, but it is not essential).\n\n\n\nFirst up, we need to define the model parameters:\nt &lt;- 100\nyinit &lt;- 1\nk &lt;- 20\nthetasd &lt;- 0.1\nr &lt;- 0.2\nNow we can run our model. I am just going to plug the models straight into microbenchmark, so I can compare their times.\nlibrary(microbenchmark)\nmb1 &lt;- microbenchmark(\n    logmodc(t, yinit, 1.4, k, thetasd),\n    logmodr(t, yinit, 1.4, k, thetasd)\n)\nmb1\n\n## Unit: microseconds\n##                                expr     min       lq      mean   median\n##  logmodc(t, yinit, 1.4, k, thetasd)  10.051  11.1100  12.70373  11.7415\n##  logmodr(t, yinit, 1.4, k, thetasd) 179.053 198.8315 251.48889 224.3450\n##        uq      max neval cld\n##   12.8825   67.801   100  a\n##  296.1400 1098.436   100   b\nSo the C++ version is 19 times faster.\n\n\n\nSo C++ is faster for a single call to a function (that contains a loop). No surprises there. What if we want to make repeated calls to the same function, is C++ still faster than R? We might want to make repeated calls if we want to run different values of r through our model to do a sensitivty analysis.\nWe could increase the scope of the C++ code to include a loop over different values of r. However, then we would lose some of the convenience of R, which is good at manipulating data. We also wouldn’t be able to use purrr package to make sensitivity analysis easy.\nFirst, up let’s create a sequence of r values:\nrseq &lt;- seq(1.1, 2.2, length.out = 10)\nNow we can run our two models. I will use purrr::map (the :: just means map is in the package purrr and avoids another call to library()). We will also use set.seed() to make sure both algorithms generate the same series of random numbers, that way we can check whether the results are identical.\nset.seed(42)\nyc &lt;- purrr::map(rseq, ~logmodc(t, yinit, .x, k, thetasd))\nset.seed(42)\nyr &lt;- purrr::map(rseq, ~logmodr(t, yinit, .x, k, thetasd))\nmap iteratively steps through rseq replacing the .x in the function call with each value of r in turn. Note that we also have to turn the function call into a formula (with ~) to iterate in this way.\nmap returns a list, where each element is a time-series of population sizes for a given value of r.\nLet’s plot the result, for the second value of r:\nplot(yr[[2]], type = \"l\", col = \"DarkBlue\", lwd = 2)\npoints(yc[[2]], pch = 16, col = \"Tomato\", cex = 0.8)\nlegend('topleft', legend = c(\"R solution\",\"C solution\"),\n       pch = 16, col = c(\"DarkBlue\", \"Tomato\"))\n\nThey look identical, excellent.\nNow, let’s compare the time. Remember I had wondered whether repeated calls to a C++ function might lose some of the performance gain:\nmb2 &lt;- microbenchmark(\n    purrr::map(rseq, ~logmodc(t, yinit, .x, k, thetasd)),\n    purrr::map(rseq, ~logmodr(t, yinit, .x, k, thetasd))\n)\nmb2\n\n## Unit: microseconds\n##                                                  expr      min        lq\n##  purrr::map(rseq, ~logmodc(t, yinit, .x, k, thetasd))  151.421  166.4165\n##  purrr::map(rseq, ~logmodr(t, yinit, .x, k, thetasd)) 1890.549 2047.6310\n##       mean    median       uq      max neval cld\n##   199.9101  179.5795  221.885  371.192   100  a\n##  2543.3459 2233.7455 2534.350 9173.440   100   b\nTurns out we still gain a 12 times improvement when using C++.\nI don’t believe I have been wasting so many hours waiting for simulations to run all these years.

    "text": "A good friend I met on a field trip long ago, Dominique Roche, recently emailed me to ask about evaluation of Bayesian models.\nHe has been delving into generalized linear models, using Bayesian methods, and needed to decide what criteria he should use for model simplification (the process of removing ‘insignificant’ covariates) and/or deciding which covariates had the strongest effect on his response of interest.\nI wanted to share an abridged version of our conversation, as I think it is enlightening. Specifically we discussed whether one can (and should) calculate the R-squared metric for Bayesian models (the short answer being that the ‘traditional’ R-squared metric doesn’t make much sense for Bayesian models, but there are alternatives).\nAs an aside, I have received a lot of helpful feedback on this post since first putting it up, so I am updating it as this comes in. I’m particularly grateful to Ben Stewart-Koster and Aki Vehtari (who’s work I cited in the original post) for pointing me towards some important literature I missed in the earlier post (which changed the advice below somewhat).\nModel selection is a fast moving area of statistical theory, so it is worth keeping updated. Many of the methods I used a few years ago are now out-of-date."

    "text": "The email chain\nDom: What criteria can I use to make inferences with my Bayesian model? I’ve used MCMCglmm (an R package) previously to run multivariate models. However, in addition to doing this in our study, we want to test the effect of multiple predictors (covariates) on our response variables. I’m curious to know if you recommend one in particular (parameter estimate and 95% CI, Bayes factor, ).\nCB: You can test the covariates very much like you did for your correlated response model. Your covariate model will estimate a slope very much like a linear regression. So if you want a criteria for inferences, you can just use the 95% CI on that slope estimate. If it overlaps zero then you could say that the effect of that covariate is ‘insignificant’.\nYou can just then compare the median and 95% CI values for your covariates to see which ones have the largest effect.\nAnother option is to use the WAIC which some stats packages will calculate for you. It is very much like the AIC and can be used to select the most parsimonious model. i.e. your compare models with different sets of covariates and pick the one (or several) with the lowest WAIC.\nNow be careful with the WAIC. You don’t want to use it for comparing a large number of candidate models, such as you would if you were fitting an model with many covariates and just simplifying it one by one (thanks to Aki Vehtari for pointing this out, here’s the details for the technically minded).\nUsing the WAIC too liberally can lead to over-fitting and poor predictive importance - by which I mean you model may fit the data at hand very well, but contains spurious effects and therefore would perform poorly if asked to explain a new dataset.\nVehtari and colleagues provide an alternative statistic for covariate selection, but unfortunately an ‘easy way’ to calculate it is only available for a few Bayesian rstats packages. If you are not using those, you will have to program it yourself or wait.\nThe WAIC will perform better with large sample sizes or for comparing a limited subset of candidate models. I would encourage you to think about writing each model as an alternative hypothesis, then just testing your set of alternatives. This will result in fewer overall tests than testing all possible combinations of covariates with the WAIC.\nAnother thing to watch out for is that your model may give funky results if the covariates are strongly correlated with each other. A good reference is the book about eco stats by Zuur that has penguins on the front cover. (One of my favourite reference books, I can never remember the title though).\nAki Vehtari added (via email) that strongly correlated covariates will throw out your marginal CIs (they will be too wide), effectively increasing the chances of a Type II error (you miss an effect that is real). He has written more about this here.\nDom: Your answer confirms what I was thinking - that reporting an estimate and 95% CI is fine for hypothesis testing, which is great.\nI’m familiar with model selection and AIC but I usually also report a pseudo R2 (usually using r.squaredGLMM) to indicate how much of the variance my model explains. There is a short paper on that topic which came out recently in JAP (which is worth reading). Do you know if there a way to compute a pseudo R2 for a multivariate Bayesian model?\nCB: In short by asking about an R2 for a Bayesian model you are opening a can of worms.\nBayesians prefer WAIC or LOO (leave one out cross validation) for evaluating models because they integrate across the full posterior probability. The R2 is a point estimate, it is just an evaluation of the mean prediction of the model (so doesn’t account for the uncertainty in parameter estimates).\nPoint estimates don’t sit well with the Bayesian philosophy. A Bayesian assumes all parameters are random variables. Whereas, a frequentist would use the R-squared because they are assuming there are actually fixed true values we are trying to observe.\nI do see the appeal of the R2 though, because it is absolute in the sense that 0.9 is 10% better than 0.8. WAIC is not like this.\nBut, a Bayesian isn’t too bothered by R2 because they spend more time looking at the posterior credibility or predictive intervals. You can predict your data using the fitted model and then just see how wide the CIs or PIs are. Wide CIs would be analogous to a poor R2.\nSome model specifications might have narrower CIs than others (for instance if you include more informative covariates).\nAfter I published this post Ben Stewart-Koster wrote to tell me that their is a way to calculate a Baysian R-squared and Gelman and colleagues have written about it here if your interested to learn more. The Bayesian R2 integrates across the modelled uncertainty, so is not a point estimate.\nAnother aside, if you are still using the DIC (similar to the WAIC) to evaluate Bayesian models you shouldn’t be. It is a point estimate, so makes the same philosophical fallacy that the R2) makes for a Bayesian model. It is also now understood to be quite unreliable.\nDom: Also, from a quick look at the paper you sent me (the one about WAIC) and the vignette for the loo package, it seems like implementing model selection for a Bayesian model using WAIC is analogous to carrying out likelihood ratio tests to compare nested models.\nHow would one go about comparing models with four predictors (no interactions)? Would you compute the WAIC by hand for all possible models and retain the ‘best’ model(s)? I’ve used the dredge function in MuMln to automate the process in the past.\nCB: The WAIC is just like the AIC, so it is a relative measure of model merit. You would jsut run all candidate models (e.g. with 4, 3, 2, 1 covariates) and compare them.\nSo far you will have to do this by hand, I’m not aware of anything that automates it like MuMln. Could be very time consuming, because bayes models tend to be slow to run.\nRather than just dredging for the best AIC, I prefer a hypothesis driven approach. So specify the subset of models that each addresses a specific hypotheses, then test and compare with WAIC to find which hypotheses have the greatest support.\nDom: RE issues of multi-collinearity - yep, I’m aware that this is something to check for. I’ve used vifs in the past for frequentist models. Is there something analogous for Bayesian models or does one simply look at correlations?\nCB: Good question wrt multicollinearity. I’m not actually sure how to formally test for it, never had this probelm in any bayesian models I’ve run. Something to research. It will be an issue in Bayesian models just as it is in frequentist models, the only exception being that you could get around the issue with strongly informative priors, but that’s another story (look at this paper if you’re interested)."

    "text": "Pipes (%&gt;%) are great for improving readibility of lengthy data processing scripts, but I’m beggining to learn they have some weaknesses when it comes to large and complex data processing.\nWe are running a number of projects at the moment that require managing and wrangling large and complex datasets. We have numerous scripts we use to document our workflow and the data wrangling steps. This has turned out to be very helpful, because when we identify bugs in the end product, we can go back and fix them.\nBut I’m starting to see a pattern. Most of the really insidious bugs occur in sections of code that use dplyr tools and pipes. These are always the types of bugs that don’t throw an error, so you get a result, it just turns out to be wrong. They are the worst kind of bugs. And hard to detect and fix.\nSo we are now moving away from using pipes in complex scripts. For simple scripts I intend to keep using them, they are so fast and easy. Here’s what we’re trying instead.\n\n\nSo here’s some made up data that mimics the kind of fish survey data we often have:\nsites &lt;- data.frame(site = letters[1:5],\n                    temp = rnorm(5, 25, 2), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\ndat &lt;- expand.grid(site = letters[1:5],\n                   transect = 1:4)\ndat$abundance &lt;- rpois(20, 11)\nSo we have site level data with a covariate, temp and transect level data with fish counts.\nNow say we have an error and one of our sites has capitals, instead of lower case, so lets introduce that bug:\nsites$site[1] &lt;- \"A\"\nNow if I join and summarize them, I will lose one of the sites\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n## Warning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 3.6.3\n\n##\n## Attaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n##\n##     filter, lag\n\n## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n##\n##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\ndat %&gt;%\n  inner_join(sites) %&gt;%\n  group_by(site) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean(abundance))\n\n## Joining, by = \"site\"\n\n## Warning: Column `site` joining factor and character vector, coercing into\n## character vector\n\n## # A tibble: 4 x 2\n##   site  `mean(abundance)`\n##   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 b                   9  \n## 2 c                  12  \n## 3 d                  12.5\n## 4 e                  12.8\nObvious enough here, but issues like that are much harder to detect in very large datasets.\n\n\n\nThe solution of course is to code in ‘unit tests’ to make sure each operations are doing what you expect. For small data you can just look, but for big datasets its not so easy.\nFor long pipes with multiple steps we’d usually do this debugging and testing interactively. So I’d write the first line (the join) save the output to a new variable, check it worked ok, then move on to write the next step of the pipe.\nNow here’s the catch. In complex project its common to change the data that goes into your pipe (in this case dat or sites dataframes). For instance, in our current project new data comes in all the time.\nNew data presents new issues. So a pipe that worked the first time may no longer work the second time.\nThis is why it is crucial to have unit tests built into your code.\nThere are lots of sophisticated R packages for unit testing, including ones that work with pipes. But given many of us are just learning tools like dplyr its not wise to add extra tools. So here I’ll show some simple unit tests with base R.\n\n\n\nJoins often case problems, due to mis-matching (e.g. if site names are spelt differently in different datasets, which is a very common human data entry error!).\nSo its wise to check the join has worked. Here’s some examples:\ndat2 &lt;- inner_join(dat, sites)\n\n## Joining, by = \"site\"\n\n## Warning: Column `site` joining factor and character vector, coercing into\n## character vector\nNow compare number of rows:\nnrow(dat2)\n\n## [1] 16\n\nnrow(dat)\n\n## [1] 20\nObviously the join has lost data in this case.\nWe can do better though with a complex script. We’d like to have an error if the data length changes. We can do this:\nnrow(dat2) == nrow(dat)\n\n## [1] FALSE\nWhich tells us TRUE/FALSE if the condition is met. To get an error use stopifnot\nstopifnot(nrow(dat2) == nrow(dat))\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the basics. No special packages, just simple logical queries.\nOf the top of my head here are a few of my most commonly used unit tests To check the number of sites has stayed the same, use length(unique(… to get the number of unique cases:\nlength(unique(dat$site))\n\n## [1] 5\n\nlength(unique(dat2$site))\n\n## [1] 4\n\nlength(unique(dat$site)) == length(unique(dat2$site))\n\n## [1] FALSE\nOr if we wanted to compare the site and dat dataframes:\nunique(sites$site) %in% unique(dat$site)\n\n## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\nThe %in% just means are the sites names in sites matching the site names in dat? (We can use stopifnot here too, with multiple TRUE/FALSE values).\nHow many don’t match?\nsum(!(unique(sites$site) %in% unique(dat$site)))\n\n## [1] 1\nThe ! is a logical ‘not’ (not FALSE = TRUE, so we are counting non-matches).\nWhich one doesn’t match?\nsites$site[!unique(sites$site) %in% unique(dat$site)]\n\n## [1] \"A\"\nHere’s another insidious bug caused by joins, when our covariate dataframe has duplicate site entries:\nsites &lt;- data.frame(site = c(letters[1:5], \"a\"),\n                    temp = c(rnorm(5, 25, 2), 11), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nsites\n\n##   site     temp\n## 1    a 19.30061\n## 2    b 23.76530\n## 3    c 24.89018\n## 4    d 25.16386\n## 5    e 23.83092\n## 6    a 11.00000\nNow we have two sites called a with different values of temp. Check out the join:\ndat2 &lt;- inner_join(dat, sites)\n\n## Joining, by = \"site\"\n\n## Warning: Column `site` joining factor and character vector, coercing into\n## character vector\n\nnrow(dat)\n\n## [1] 20\n\nnrow(dat2)\n\n## [1] 24\nSo its added rows, ie made up data we didn’t have. Why? Well the join duplicated all the site a values for both values of temp:\nfilter(dat2, site == \"a\")\n\n##   site transect abundance     temp\n## 1    a        1        10 19.30061\n## 2    a        1        10 11.00000\n## 3    a        2        11 19.30061\n## 4    a        2        11 11.00000\n## 5    a        3        12 19.30061\n## 6    a        3        12 11.00000\n## 7    a        4         9 19.30061\n## 8    a        4         9 11.00000\nNo watch this, we can really go wrong when we summarize:\ndat2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(site) %&gt;%\n  summarize(sum(abundance))\n\n## # A tibble: 5 x 2\n##   site  `sum(abundance)`\n##   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n## 1 a                   84\n## 2 b                   36\n## 3 c                   48\n## 4 d                   50\n## 5 e                   51\nIt looks like site a has twice as many fish as it really does (78, when it should have 39). So imagine you had a site dataframe you were happy worked, then your collaborator sent you a new one to use, but it had duplicate rows. If you didn’t have the unit test to check your join in place, you may never know about this doubling of data error.\nWe could check for this by checking for the number of transects e.g.\ndat_ntrans &lt;- dat2 %&gt;% group_by(site) %&gt;% summarize(n = n())\ndat_ntrans\n\n## # A tibble: 5 x 2\n##   site      n\n##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n## 1 a         8\n## 2 b         4\n## 3 c         4\n## 4 d         4\n## 5 e         4\n\ndat_ntrans$n != 4\n\n## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n(Yes I used a pipe this time, but a simple one).\n\n\n\n(This part is new as of 2020-04-22)\nSo once this post got shared I got a lot of feedback. A lot of lovely people wrote me with the timeless rstats cliche “there’s a package for that” (I say that being an abuser of that cliche myself).\nSo if you really want to get into unit testing and take it to the next level here’s a few of the tips I received.\nRoger Bivand wrote to tell me about validate package, which comes with a whole book in pdf format on data cleaning (that is now on my ‘lockdown’ reading list).\nAnother popular one is testthat, which I received many recommendations for (haven’t used it myself).\nEd Hagen shared tidylog that conveniently prints messages telling you what join and so on have done did (pretty low overhead on learning this one!). Might be good package to install if you are just learning dplyr too, as it reveals more about what is going on.\nDavid Aja and others messaged me about point blank, which integrates unit testing into pipes.\nThese are all great solutions for the advanced R user. My challenge with them is that students get worn down by hearing “there’s another R package for that”. So best solution is take it step-by-step, get some simple unit testing going first. If that’s not enough to get the job done, then start using these tools, once you’re comfortable with the basics.\n\n\n\nSo I plan on keeping up pipes, but just for simple things. For complex scripts we’ll break the pipes with more intermediate tests and do more unit testing. It’ll save a lot of pain down the road."

    "text": "Sitting on narrow rock ledge, the cold Tasmanian ocean at my feet, I wondered if ten years of living in the sub-tropics was going to ruin my attempt to dive back into the underwater forests of my youth.\nI was visiting colleagues in my childhood state of Tasmania when someone mentioned a dense kelp forest, crawling with large rock lobster, which had regrown inside one of Tasmania’s marine reserves.\nIt sounded like the mythical ecosystems described in the accounts of early European explorers. That is, in the days before climate change and industrial fishing took their toll on ocean ecosystems across the globe, including in Tasmania.\n\nA Macrocystis forest. Photo: Megan Saunders\nI had only one weekend left in Tasmania, but I made it a priority to dive this kelp forest. I borrowed a mask from a friend, dug up my stiff old wetsuit from my parent’s basement and fixed ageing fins with cable ties.\nWhen growing up near Hobart I often sought out opportunities for diving in kelp forests, specifically the Giant Kelp Macrocystis. Giant kelp is remarkable because its fast growth (up to 35cm a day) can lead to dense forests that grow from ocean floor to surface and shade out sunlight. If you dive in a kelp forest on a bright day you will be bathed in the golden rays of the sun reflecting off the kelp’s fronds.\nThere is another world to explore in a kelp forest. If you free dive, as I typically did as a teen (scuba was too expensive) on every dive you swim down through a multitude of micro-ecosystems, from canopy to holdfast. Caprellid amphipods, which resemble a praying mantis, graze in the fronds near the surface. Mid-water you might encounter schools of Bastard Trumpeter or spiny boarfish. On the bottom, the kelp’s holdfast, a tangled mass of root like structures, hosts an array of zany looking invertebrates.\n\nBastard Trumpeter Latridopsis forsteri, cruise a kelp forest. Photo: Megan Saunders\nKelp forests were so important to my upbringing that they were the topic of the first conversation I had with my now wife (she is also a diver from another other great bastion of kelp forests - the west coast of North America).\nKelp forests became a fast disappearing ecosystem as I grew up and were increasingly difficult to find.\nIt’s estimated that Giant Kelp occupies &lt;1% of its former range in Tasmania’s waters.\nGiant Kelp likes cold nutrient rich water. Warming oceans and the strengthening East Australia Current have brought warm nutrient-poor waters to Tasmania’s coast over the past several decades, all but wiping out the Giant Kelp.\nThe warm waters also carried the larvae of the Purple Sea Urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii) to Tasmania, where it did not previously occur. It is a voracious consumer of kelp, and rapidly transforms massive forests into rocky barrens. It is so effective that just a few individuals, who can live as long as 30 years, can prevent any kelp re-establishing in an area.\nI was under no illusions that the ecosystems I knew as a teen would be somehow preserved for all time, as some people see the places of their teen adventures. I even participated in a kelp forest restoration project at one stage.\nThough they were few and far between, there were always the good sites with dense kelp forests. These became important fixed points in my experience. Places I could go back to and remember a younger life, like when you catch up with old school friends to talk gossip from 20 years ago.\nYears later in 2016, as an adult, I visited one of the most reliable sites. Somewhat ironically, it had always been good because pollution from a sewage outflow saw that there were always plenty of nutrients in the water. In 2016 all that remained were a few scraggy strands of kelp.\nA casual observers wouldn’t know the loss I felt. To them it would just be another part of the ocean, filled with empty blue water. To me, however, swimming through the empty water was like walking over the ashes of a razed forest.\n2016 was also the first year of what turned into two consecutive years of mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, in my now home state of Queensland. While the world watched in horror at the devastation that climate change wrought on the reef, the forests of my childhood quietly faded away.\nSo I found myself this past weekend on my own navigating down a gravel track, on the side of a steep cliff, with a weightbelt slung over my shoulder. I squeezed into my old wetsuit (it still fits remarkably) and slid down into the cold ocean.\nAs I swam out to the kelp forest, I hoped I would recall the techniques of relaxing into a free dive, so I could hold my breath for long enough to descend into the forest. Free diving is the sport of holding one’s breath so that you can swim to depth, unhindered by scuba gear.\nWhile this serene sport may seem innocuous, mistakes can be deadly. Relax for too long and go too deep and you may not make it back to the top. It is best to dive with a partner for safety, though today I was on my own. The day before my dive I had visited the seaside memorial of a school friend who had died, on his own, during a free dive. I felt his absence today, he was once a free diver and prodigiuos hunter of lobster, and would certainly have joined me on this trip.\nI reached the kelp forest, but my first dives were frantic and I quickly bounced back to the surface for air. But then I found my old skills and was able to relax into dives.\nIt was fitting perhaps for that the day was grey and the visibility underwater poor, so like my memories of childhood dives, the kelp forest was hazy. But the feeling of gliding down from canopy to holdfast was the same, and I still wondered at strange animals that lived there.\nI searched for lobster for a while, but found none. The forest is in a reserve, so there should be no fishing, but I wondered if poachers had been there before me.\nThe ongoing presence of lobsters may be crucial to the kelp’s survival. Large lobsters eat purple sea urchins and can push them back before they get a chance to establish and devour the forest.\nIt is indicative that the kelp holds on in a place where lobster fishing is banned.\nThat the kelp still holds on in a few places is a sign of hope that Tasmania’s ecosystems can withstand climate change.\nAs I made my way back up the cliff track after the dive, I thought about the cliche of arguing we do more to save nature, like creating more marine reserves, so our children can visit these places we were fortunate to experience. But our children will develop their own fixed points of experience as they grow and as the baseline for what is natural shifts from generation to generation the old baselines of their forbearers may not give them much concern.\nI hope my children don’t have the same childhood experience of nature as I had. I hope they can expect things to get better and that their shifting baseline is one of degraded ecosystems that are recovering.\nThere are signs of hope. The talk of Hobart that week had been the sighting of a southern right whale just a hundred metres from shore in the Derwent estuary. Right whales were almost driven to extinction by whale hunting, but now they are protected they are making a slow recovery.\n\nA snorkeller watches a southern right whale that visited the Derwent estuary. Photo: Mick Brown\nControversy surrounded this particular whale, which made the front page of the local news paper. Many onlookers reported it seemed distressed as it was mobbed by swimmers, boats and jetskis.\nI see this debate as a good sign. We need more conversations about what helps and what hinders nature’s recovery. The more people start to notice the empty spaces in our ocean, the more hope there is that society will notice its loss and take action to restore nature."

    "text": "Associate Professor Chris Brown has two new opportunities for PhD projects in fisheries. We place an emphasis on the application of science to real-world management, communication skills and training of quantitative skills. Past PhD graduates from Chris’ lab have worked on a range of areas including, from field, lab, modelling and GIS focussed projects. All were keen to make a difference and had a desire to learn quantitative methods (e.g. R).\nA background with quantitative skills is encouraged, but not essential. Training quantitative skills is something we specialise in.\nRead more about Chris’ lab, research and his team here and the Global Wetlands Project here.\nIf you are interested, please read the project descriptions below and contact Chris for further information. Australian applicants should have at a minimum first class Honours from their degree.\nInternational applicants should have equivalent of first class honours (e.g. research focused masters with GPA 6+) and either of: substantial (3+ years) research relevant work experience and/or first authored publication in an internationally recognised journal. There are fewer international scholarship positions at UTas than domestic scholarships, so scholarships are more competitive than for domestic applicants.\nFurther details are on the UTas site via below links:\nFuture of seafood (modelling focus includes $5000 pa scholarship topup)\nHabitats for fisheries (fieldwork and some modelling)"

For instance, just like excel plots dont:\nx &lt;- rnorm(100)\ndat &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = 0.25*x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.2))\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_excel() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\nYou can get additional themes for ggplot2 using this excellent package. A cleaner view:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_base() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\nOr simply:\nplot(dat$x, dat$y, xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"y\", las = 1)\n\nA good principle is to not use ‘ink’ on figures that isn’t needed to communicate your message. Tufte takes the ‘less ink’ philosophy to the extreme:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_tufte() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\n\n\nWhen is ggplot2 appropriate, or when should I use base R?\nIn general I think ggplot2 is appropriate for problems of intermediate complexity. Like this:\n Base R is great if you just want to plot a barplot quickly, or do an x-y plot. ggplot2 comes into its own for slight more complex plots, like having multiple panels for different groups or colouring lines by a 3rd factor. But once you move to really complex plots, like overlaying a subplot on a map, ggplot2 becomes very difficult, if not impossible. At that point it is better to move back to Base R. ggplot2 can also get very fiddly if you are very specific about your plots, like having certain colours, or the labels in a certain way.\nAs an example, ggplot2 is great for data like this:\nx1 &lt;- rnorm(30)\ngrps &lt;- letters[c(rep(1, 10), rep(2, 10), rep(3, 10))]\ny1 &lt;- x1 + c(rep(1, 10), rep(-1, 10), rep(2, 10)) + rnorm(30)\ndat &lt;- data.frame(x = x1, grps = grps, y = y1)\nhead(dat)\n\n##             x grps             y\n## 1  0.19033984    a  6.159889e-01\n## 2 -0.07173877    a -7.577584e-05\n## 3 -0.00285171    a -1.003277e+00\n## 4 -1.10821896    a -7.302877e-01\n## 5  0.93519177    a  2.662337e+00\n## 6 -1.48583945    a -1.588023e+00\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x1, y = y1, color = grps)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw()\n\nIt is also pretty handy for faceting:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() + facet_wrap(~grps)+\n  theme_bw()\n\nThe key with ggplot2 is to have your data in a data-frame.\nIn reality both ggplot2 and base R graphics are worth learning, but I would start with learning the basics of base R graphics and then move onto ggplot2 if you want to quickly plot lots of structured data-sets.\n\n\nPie graphs vs bar graphs\nIn Mariani et al. they plot rates of seafood fraud by several European countries. While its a foundational study that establishes improvement in the accuracy of food labelling, their graphics could be improved in several ways.\nFirst they use perspective pies. This makes it incredibly hard to compare the two groups (fish that are labelled/mislabelled). Humans are very bad at comparing angles and pretty bad at comparing areas. With the perspective you can’t even compare the areas properly. They do provide the raw numbers, but then, why bother with the pies? Note that the % pies misrepresent the data slightly because the % figures are actually odds ratios (mis-labels / correct labels), rather than percent (mis-labeels / total samples). Second the pies are coloured red/green, which will be hard for red-green colourblind people to see. Third, they have coloured land blue on their map, so it appears to be ocean at first look. Fourth, the map is not really neccessary. There are no spatial patterns going on that the authors want to draw attention to. I guess having a map does emphasize that the study is in Europe. Finally, the size of each pie is scaled to the sample size, but the scale bar for the sample size shows a sample of only 30, whereas most of their data are for much larger samples sizes (&gt;200). Do you get the impression from the pies that the UK has 668 samples, whereas Ireland only has 187? Therefore, from this graphic we have no idea what sample size was used in each country.\nIn fact, all the numbers that are difficult to interpret in the figure are very nicely presented in Table 1.\nBelow is a start at improving the presentation. For instance, you could do a simple bar chart, ordering by rate of mislabelling.\ncnames &lt;- c('Ireland' ,'UK','Germany','France','Spain','Portugal')\ncorrlab &lt;- c(180, 647, 145, 146, 267, 178)\nmislab &lt;- c(7, 21, 9, 4, 24, 12)\nmisrate &lt;- 100*signif(mislab / (corrlab + mislab),2)\ncorrrate &lt;- 100 - misrate\nord &lt;- order(misrate, decreasing = T)\ny &lt;- rbind(corrrate, misrate)\n\npar(mar = c(5,4,4,7))\nbarplot(y[,ord], names.arg = cnames[ord], col = c('skyblue','tomato'), ylab = 'Labelling rate (%)', las = 2)\nlegend(x=7.5, y = 90, legend = c(\"Mislabelled\", \"Correctly labelled\"), pch = 16, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), xpd = NA, cex = 0.7)\n\nYou could add another subfigure to this, showing the rate by different species too.\nThe barplot doesn’t communicate the sample size, but then that is probably not the main point. The sample sizes are probably best reported in the table\nIf we felt the map was essential, then putting barcharts on it would be more informative. It is not that easy to add barcharts ontop of an existing map in R, so I would recommend creating the barcharts seperately, then adding them on in Illustrator or Powerpoint.\nWe can make a basic map like this:\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(maptools)\nmap('world', xlim = c(-20, 20), ylim = c(35, 60), col = 'grey', fill = T)\n\nThen create some nice barcharts. We write a loop so we get one barchart for each country.\nnc &lt;- length(cnames)\npar(mfrow = c(2,3), oma = c(1,1,1,3))\nfor (i in 1:nc){\n  y &lt;- c(mislab[i], corrlab[i])\n  barplot(y, names.arg = '', las = 2, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), ylim = c(0, corrlab[i]), main = cnames[i], cex.main = 2.4, yaxt = 'n')\n  byy &lt;- signif(max(y),2)/3\n  yat &lt;- c(0, min(y), max(y))\naxis(2, at = yat, las = 2, cex.axis = 2, labels = F)\naxis(2, at = yat[2:3], las = 2, cex.axis = 2, labels = T)\n}\nlegend(x = 2.8, y = 500, legend = c('Fraud', 'Correct'), pch = 15, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), xpd = NA, cex = 2, bty = 'n')\n\n\n\nScaling matters\nIt can be misleading to present % and proportion data on axes that are not scaled 0 - 100%. For instance, compare these three graphs:\ny &lt;- c(70, 72, 68, 73)\nx &lt;- 1:4\nxnams &lt;- LETTERS[1:4]\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,3), oma = c(1,1,1,3), mar = c(5,6,2,2))\nplot(x,y, pch = 3, cex = 2, las = 1, xaxt  = 'n', xlab = '', ylab = 'Percent', cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, tcl = 0.5, xlim = c(0, 5), col = 'red', lwd = 3)\naxis(1, at = x, labels = xnams, cex.axis = 2, tcl = 0.5)\n\nbarplot(y, names.arg = xnams, las = 1, cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.names = 2, ylab = 'Percent')\n\nbarplot(y, names.arg = xnams, las = 1, cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.names = 2, ylab = 'Percent', ylim = c(0, 100))"

Luckily there is a package to help you make the right decision for a colour scale, it is called RColorBrewer. Check out colorbrewer.org for a helpful interactive web interface for choosing colours.\nFirst let’s load some sea surface temperature data as a raster:\nlibrary(raster)\nr &lt;- raster(\"MeanAVHRRSST\")\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(r, col = rev(brewer.pal(11, \"Spectral\")), asp = NA)\nplot(r, col = brewer.pal(11, \"Purples\"), asp = NA)\n\n## Warning in brewer.pal(11, \"Purples\"): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Purples is 9\n## Returning the palette you asked for with that many colors\n\nUsing red-green palettes makes it hard for colour blind people. Also, using a diverging palette makes it look like there is something important about the middle point (yellow). A better palette to use would be one of the sequential ones, “Purples” shown here.\nTo make it easier to understand, let’s look at these again as contour plots. I will use a more appropriate diverging palette to the red-green one though.\nz &lt;- matrix(rep(1:10, 10), nrow = 10)\nfilled.contour(z, col = brewer.pal(9, 'Reds'), nlevels = 10)\n\nfilled.contour(z, col = brewer.pal(9, 'RdBu'), nlevels = 10)\n\nNotice the diverging pallette creates an artificial split at yellow\nOne of the only legitimate uses for pie graphs (I think) is visualising the colour scales.

In the past having this package has been essential for just about any spatial analysis in R, whether it was GIS or spatial modelling.\nA newish package on the block sf has much the same functionality as sp, but promises to be much more convenient and flexible. It has been around a few years (I think), but there was little information about it. The release of the book Geocomputation with R and an increasing number of solutions on stackoverlow will probably see an many more people using sf.\nsf works with a language independent standard for structuring spatial data termed ‘simple features’. Just a few of the many nice aspects of sf are:\nIntuitive data structures sp data, like the SpatialPolygonsDataframe were composed of lists inside lists and were quite hard to decompose (there was a good reason why it was coded like this, but I forget why). sf objects are just data-frames that are collections of spatial objects. Each row is a spatial object (e.g. a polgyon), that may have data associated with it (e.g. its area) and a special geo variable that contains the coordinates.\nIntuitive operations One thing that frustrated me about spatial operations (like intersection) with sp and rgeos (the package for geographic operations), was that a dataframe sp object changed to a different, data-less, class when the operation was performed. sf objects don’t change class when you apply spatial operations to them (and they keep their associated data).\nSpatial indexing which can massively speed up spatial queries, like intersecting polygons, especially on large datasets."

In fact, I do teach it now, even in general R courses, like this one for conservation biologists.\nCreating interactive maps is a lot of fun and potentially very useful. For instance see Ross Dwyer’s maps that let you explore the distributions of sharks and rays around the world (this one may take a moment to load, as the data-sets are large).\nSo in the future GIS and spatial analysis in R should become more straightfoward and you should be able to smoothly integrate R’s outputs with many other programs."

This is handy because it means you can easily calculate probabilities for any arbitrary transformation of your parameters.\nFor instance, we used this trick to calculate the probability that animal abundance was greater in an experimental treatment vs the control. Using a GAM meant we could also account for non-linear temporal effects.\nThe example I give below is for probability of exceeding a threshold.\nSimon Wood explains in his book that there is a theoretical equivalence between GAMs from his package and an empirical Bayesian analysis. In short, the GAM penalty parameters (the ones that control the wiggliness of the non-linear fits) are analogous to Bayesian priors.\nThe reason we say ‘empirical’ Bayesian analysis is that the smoothing parameters are estimated from data, rather than having a prior.\n\nGetting credible intervals from a GAM\n\nSet-up data\nThis is well documented in Wood’s book as well as in the mgcv help files, see examples in ?predict.gam.\nI made myself a handy little function to implement the CIs, which we will use in this post.\nHere’s the set-up, including sourcing in my function\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\n## Loading required package: nlme\n\n## This is mgcv 1.8-42.

Let’s assume we are measuring biological responses (`y’) to a toxin:\nset.seed(2024)\nn &lt;- 50\ntoxin &lt;- sort(runif(n, 0, 1))\ndat &lt;- data.frame(toxin = toxin)\ndat &lt;- within(dat, {\n  ytrue = 6*toxin  - 7*toxin^2\n  yobs = ytrue + rnorm(n, sd = 0.2)\n})\n\nggplot(dat) + \n  aes(x = toxin, y= yobs) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y = ytrue))\n\nytrue is the true values of the function, and yobs are our data on this variable.\n\n\nFit a GAM\nNow fit a GAM and add its predictions to our dataframe:\nm1 &lt;- gam(yobs ~ s(toxin), \n          data = dat)\ndat$ypred &lt;- predict(m1)\n\nggplot(dat) + \n  aes(x = toxin, y= yobs) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y = ytrue)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = ypred), col = 'red')\n\nThe red line just shows the predictions from the fitted GAM, relative to the true curve (black line).\n\n\nPlotting predictions with CIs\nThe first application of the empirical Bayes trick is to create a plot of predictions with credible intervals.\nI won’t go into the detail of the implementation, please see Wood’s book and ?predict.gam for more info. But in short, you can sample predictions from the joint distribution of parameters and their covariances. We are assuming that parameters and their uncertainties are described by a multivariate normal distribution (methods like HMC and MCMC allow you to relax this assumption, such as when parameter values are skewed or multi-modal).\nWe need to account for parameter covariances because a higher estimate of one parameter might imply a lower or higher estimate for another parameter. e.g. slope and intercept values for a linear fit are negatively correlated (a low slope high intercept fit will have similar sums of squares to a high slope low intercept fit).\nMy function (simulate_gam_CIs) just implements the instructions given in ?predict.gam. If you are using more complex models I recommend diving into the code yourself, as I can’t guarantee it works in all cases (e.g. doesn’t work for models with coefficients on the variance parameter like the gaulss family).\ngamCIs &lt;- simulate_gam_CIs(m1,\n                 newdata = dat,\n                 forms = list(~x), \n                 random_var = NULL,\n                 offset = 0,\n                 probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975),\n                 nsims = 1000)\nThe function is drawing 1000 values from the posterior of the model. It then transforms the values according to the function given at forms. In this case we are not doing any transformation.\nFinally, it calculates the 2.5, 50 and 97.5% quantiles across those 1000 values, at each x value in the dataframe. It outputs a list of transformations, where each item corresponds to one of the formulas.\nSo basically here we now have 95% credible intervals, and the median.\nLet’s plot that:\nggplot(dat) + \n  aes(x = toxin, y= yobs) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y = ytrue)) + \n  geom_line(data = gamCIs[[1]], aes(y = X50.), col = 'purple') + \n  geom_ribbon(data = gamCIs[[1]], aes(ymin = X2.5., ymax = X97.5.),\n              color = NA, fill = \"purple\", alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\nProbability of exceeding a threshold\nA non-linear transform we might like to do is to find the probability of the mean exceeding a threshold, any arbitrary value of x. Let’s find that probability for exceeding a value of 1 all the observed values of x.\nIn this case we don’t want quantiles over the posterior samples, we want to know what’s the probability of x&gt;1. Since the function x&gt;1 returns a logical, we can simply sum() over the posterior samples and divide by the number of samples to get the probability. So below we specify func_to_apply = \"sum\".\ngam_prob_exceed1 &lt;- simulate_gam_CIs(m1,\n                 newdata = dat,\n                 forms = list(~x&gt;1), \n                 random_var = NULL,\n                 offset = 0,\n                 probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975),\n                 nsims = 1000, \n                 func_to_apply = \"sum\")\n\nggplot(gam_prob_exceed1[[1]]) + \n  aes(x = toxin, y =prob) + \n  geom_line() +\n  ylab(\"Probability of the mean of y exceeding a value of 1\")\n\nCouple of important points. When providing a formula x is the name I used in the function to refer to the linear predictor (ie predictions for mean of our response), its not the ‘x-variable’.\nWe are predicting the probability the mean exceeds a threshold above, not the probability of data observations exceeding a threshold. That would be called a predictive interval and we would need to additionally sample from the observation distribution (in this case a normal).\n\n\n\nApplications\nI find this empirical Bayesian interpretation of GAMs very handy. I use it when:\n\nIts impractical to fit a full Bayesian model, such as for large datasets or simulation applications where I need to repeat fitting 1000s of times. GAMs are generally much faster than numerical Bayesian methods like HMC or MCMC.\nI’m working with a collaborator that knows GAMs but not Bayesian models\nI want to get predictions on the natural scale for a GAM that is fitted with a link function (e.g. poisson with log-link)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Learning from failures\n\n“There is no winning and losing, only winning and learning”\n“Own your mistakes”\nSiri Lindley two times Triathlon World Cup winner1\n\nAn old adage goes ‘learn from your mistakes’. In general, this is good advice. Mistakes are an opportunity to reflect on what went wrong and what you could improve upon next time you are faced with a similar situation. The problem is, it is not always that easy to see failures as mistakes.\nBy failures I mean ‘lack of success’, which could be due to your own fault, other people, or random change. By mistakes I specifically mean ‘lack of success attributed to your own actions’. If you do not view failures as being a result of your own actions, you cannot ask how you can improve upon similar situations in the future.\nBut it can hard to accept that a failure is our own mistake. Most of us are socially preconditioned to avoid blame. It can also be hard emotionally to blame yourself. Accepting a failure as your own entails accepting greater responsibility for your actions.\nOf course, you need to be honest with yourself. Most failures are a mix of your own decisions, other people’s and random chance.\nAs an example, consider those particularly nasty reviews you have likely got (or will get eventually if you are just starting out in academia) on a paper you submitted.\n\n\n\nA quote from a review I got as a young researcher on a now published paper\n\n\nWhen confronted with highly negative criticism, it is easy to lay the blame on the reviewer. “They have a narrow view of the world”, “they are old and grumpy”, “they were annoyed because we didn’t cite more of their own work”, “they missed the point” are all phrases I have heard (or spoken!) in response to difficult reviews.\nWhile there may be elements of truth in those comments, your objective is obviously to get the paper published. The reviewer may be grumpy, because they were tired and overworked. The solution - write for tired and overworked people! Just blaming others doesn’t help you improve it for the next round of review. It may be better to take some of the blame on yourself and ask how you could avoid such comments in future. For instance, try turning\n\n“They have a narrow view of the world” into “we need to do a better job of providing context for this study”;\n“they are old and grumpy” into “we need to work to establish our work in light of older research paradigms”;\n“they were annoyed because we didn’t cite more of their own work” into “we should be careful to acknowledge a broader range of literature”; and\n“they missed the point” into “we need to state the problem we are addressing more clearly”.\n\n\nOwning your mistakes\nSo how can you own your mistakes so they have maximal (positive) psychological impact so you learn the lesson? Here are a few ways I have thought about.\n\nTell other people about your mistakes. For instance, acknowledge to your coauthors that a particular review criticism related to part of the paper you had written. The flip side is you should acknowledge your own and other people’s successes too.\nWrite about mistakes in your annual review. At my uni we have annual reviews of our performance and PhD students have regular reviews on the progress of their thesis. It is tempting to just put all your successes in these reports. I think it is important to acknowledge mistakes in these forums. It will help you consolidate the lesson and perhaps provide your supervisors an opportunity to give you helpful advice. As an example, I received criticism on a grant application that I had too many co-authored (not first authored) publications. While such comments can hurt, because of the time we have invested in our careers, looking at this criticism I realised I had been investing too much time on helping with other people’s projects. Acknowledging this bias helped me set goals in my annual report for focussing on leading publications, and rapidly turn the situation around.\nSee avoided losses as success. For instance, say you start a project that you expect will require 2 months of lab work. Two months in you have made little progress, and you realise the project is much harder than you initially thought. If you decide to terminate the project now you could save a lot more wasted time that would be better spent on other things. While you could view this as 2 months wasted, you could also view it in light of the future time you save by stopping the project early. Thus, I think it is helpful to report on such mistakes as successes, because you avoided more wasted time.\nTry to think objectively when other people offer you excuses. For instance, your supervisor might write-off a bad review as coming from their grumpy academic nemesis. That might be the case, but doesn’t mean you can’t still learn how to improve your paper from the feedback you received (as above).\nDo a pre-mortem on new projects. I learned this one from Daniel Kahneman’s book ’Thinking, Fast and Slow. You do a pre-mortem once you have written the initial conception and plan for a project. Get yourself and other team members to sit down and imagine all the ways the project could fail. Have them write down a list of ways the project could fail independently before you discuss your lists. Then see if there are ways to design the project to avoid failures or mitigate losses. Pre-mortems help us learn from mistakes before they even happen and are particularly important when we can’t afford to make mistakes.\n\nSo be hard on yourself if you want to learn from your mistakes, but not too hard.\n1: Once again I have drawn inspiration from endurance athletics. I got the idea for this blog post from listening to a podcast where Tony Robbins interviews Siri Lindley about what made her successful as a Triathlete. I highly recommend you check it out."

    "title": "Wind predicts connectivity for coral reef fish",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Wind predicts connectivity for coral reef fish\nConnectivity of organisms among habitats is fundamental to population dynamics, the evolution of species and their conservation. Two paradigms of connectivity dominate marine science. The first is the movement of larvae from their natal sites to their settlement sites. The second is the movement of fish from juvenile habitats, like mangroves, to adult habitats, like coral reefs.\nIn a new paper published in the journal Ecology, we show that sheltered conditions have both high larval and habitat connectivity and we subsequently predict a synergistic increase in fish biomass in sheltered environments.\n\n\n\nWe hypothesized that larval retention would be lower on more exposed coasts, because of wind-driven advection. Exposed coasts also will have lower reef to mangrove connectivity, because mangroves prefer sheltered conditions. Under sheltered conditions, connectivity to mangroves and of larvae was hypothesized to be greater, leading to a synergistic increase in adult fish biomass on reefs. Image from our paper\n\n\nRarely have these two paradigms been linked. However, linkages among them could be important. For instance, we should see higher abundances of adult fish in locations where ocean currents facilitate arrival of larvae to their favourite juvenile habitats. Such places may offer double the benefits to larvae and may be especially productive locations for fisheries, or key spawning sites to reserve in protected areas.\nWe asked if the high larval connectivity in terms of larvae returning to their natal site, was correlated with high connectivity among juvenile and adult habitats. To study larval and habitat linkages, we used data and comprehensive larval modelling from The Bahamas.\nWe found for three different fish species that the reef sites with higher retention of larvae were also more likely to have connected coral reefs and mangroves. The fish species larvae spend different amounts of time in the open ocean, suggesting the relationship is general across many species.\nIt turned out that exposure to wind and waves explained both high retention and connectivity among coral reefs and mangroves. The explanation is simple - mangroves like sheltered conditions so coral reefs are typically only close to mangroves in sheltered locations. Fish larvae are carried by ocean currents, so if there are high wind and waves they are more likely to be carried away. In sheltered conditions, the larvae hang around.\nThe effect of exposure on both larval and habitat connectivity is a real boon for fish populations. Our models predicted a synergistic increase in fish biomass in sheltered locations that resulted from a positive feedback loop: More larvae retained near their preferred mangroves meant more juveniles migrating to reefs where they spawned more larvae that settled in mangroves… and so on.\nOf course there is much work left to do. The predicted synergistic increase in fish biomass is yet to be tested in the field. However, our approach generates quantitative relationships between exposure and fish biomass that could be tested in against field surveys.\nAnother caveat to consider is that connectivity may also benefit a fish’s predators.\nValidating our predictions would be of great benefit to the conservation of reef fish. For instance, using one variable along - exposure - we can predict the reef sites most suited to fish and identify productivity hotspots that are likely important for natural ecosystems and fisheries.\nRead more: Brown, C.

    "title": "Species on the Move - Day 1 synopsis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Species on the Move - Day 1 synopsis\n10 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania\nThis is my take on some of the highlights and main themes from day one of the Species on the Move conference, in Hobart. See also the day 2 synopsis and day 3 synopsis and some lessons learned.\n\n\n\nThis is my take that is obviously biased towards the talks I saw. I feel your pain Gretta!\n\n\nIt is striking that the ecological effects of climate change are now a personal experience for many people. The ecological impacts of climate change are no longer an abstract concept scientists talk about, or something that happens in models and experiments. I think this speaks to how pervasive the impacts of climate change have become.\nWe should not underestimate the psychological impact that witnessing climate change has personally\nEmma Lee, a Tasmanian Aborigine, gave a passionate talk about how her cultural history in the form of ‘living sites’ or middens was literally being washed away by sea level rise. For a culture that has already lost so much, the further loss of some of their last remaining cultural sites, dating back thousands of years, is devastating. She spoke about the power of science as an outlet to help Aboriginal people tell their story about change over 10 000 years of life in Tasmania. Science can also help uncover some of the lost history of Aboriginals, before it is washed away.\nTero Mustonen spoke about the contribution of indigenous people in Finland to science, through their monitoring of species range shifts and permaforst melting. Locally, in Tasmania Ingrid Van Putten showed that fishers are already attributing the changes they see in fisheries to climate change, well some of them. Which ones they choose to attribute to climate change can be predicted by cognitive biases.\nFrom these talks I learnt that science has an important role to play in helping people communicate their stories and comprehend change.\nClimate change is now so rapid that individual scientists have seen their predictions borne our during the course of their careers.\n\n\n\nThe conference was succesful at attracting broad interest in the media, including from ABC news.\n\n\nWell, sort of. There are always unexpected ecological outcomes. Camille Parmesan spoke of how she had predicted climate-driven extinction of a butterfly species and it almost did go extinct while policy makers were arguing over what to do about it. The butterfly ended up saving itself by evolving to utilise a new host plant so saved itself.\nThe conference organisers should be be commended for a series of plenary talks that is representative of both career-stages and gender in our field\nI was pleased to see a balanced list of both men and women plenary speakers. This is representative of the relatively young field of climate change ecology where many of the most influential researchers are women (think Parmesan, Elith, Poloczanska, Sorte, Sunday to name a few). Other, more established, fields should aspire to have such a diverse population. Just speculating, but I think other fields suffer from an established, ‘old guard’ who prevent the career progression of younger women (e.g. through sexist reviews). Climate change ecology doesn’t seem to have this problem to the same extent, which makes it a more enjoyable and stimulating field to participate in. The science has benefitted greatly from this diversity too.\nIt was also great to see some exceptional early career researchers like Jenn Sunday from UBC, included on the plenary list. In her short career, Sunday has become the leading name in the theory of range edges and range shifts. It was great to hear where the research frontiers are from the upcoming generation of climate change ecologists.\nOn the topic of Sunday’s talk we learnt that Species traits can help predict variation in range shifts.\nClimate change ecology has made a natural progression from documenting range shifts to asking why different species vary in the rate of their range shift. Sunday spoke about large range size and omnivory as determinants of more rapid range shifts. She then backed up these findings with solid ecological theories that provide new hypotheses for our field to test.\n\n\n\nWe should be careful to repeat resurveys, to make sure we don’t miss rare species, like this 40-spotted pardalote (striated pardalote also pictured).\n\n\nOther talks also pointed to the role of species traits in determing rates of range shift. For instance, Jonathan Lenoir spoke about how herbaceous plants were moving faster up elevational gradients than woody species.\nOther talks suggested caution in interpreting the data underlying range shifts, myself included.\nMorgan Tingley gave us five issues we should consider when comparing historical and resurvey data. He advised caution in interpreting historical data and pointed to the need to thoroughly know your data and check its source. His suggestions included ‘repeat repeat repeat’ - that you should repeat occupancy surveys so you can calculate detection rates of your species and in doing so separate false absences of a species from true extirpations.\nWe also heard about the mechanisms of leading edge shifts. Mike Kearney in his plenary spoke about a new R package NicheMapR which promises to change the way we do species distribution models from statistical to mechanistic. Dave Schoeman spoke about temperature controls on the leading edge of ghost crabs the ‘ideal’ study species for climate range shifts. Finally, Cascade Sorte talked resolving the effect of ocean currents on range shifts.\nThat is all I have time to write. I wish I could say more. Before you finish, don’t forget to vote on the video competition!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Applications for the postdoc job and PhD position have now closed, but I have kept the post here for reference\nProfessor Rod Connolly (Griffith University), Professor Isabelle Côté (Simon Fraser University) and I will be recruiting a postdoc and a PhD student in 2018 to work on our project “Predicting interactive effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems” funded by the Australian Research Council.\nWe will advertise officially next year, but feel free to get in touch with me ahead of time (chris.brown@griffith.edu.au) if you are interested in discussing either of these positions.\n\nThe project aims to create an innovative model to predict how multiple stressors interact to affect marine ecosystems across large spatial scales. The interactive effects of multiple stressors are poorly quantified in the marine environment, and natural resource managers are not able to confidently incorporate these complex interactions into prioritizing management efforts in space and time. The project intends to develop models, validated in the field that will predict, a-priori, the type of interactions that may occur. This should enable ecosystem managers to better prioritise actions to more effectively conserve valuable and threatened marine ecosystems.\n\nFor the postdoc position we are seeking a PhD ecologist who is competent in quantitative methods. The project may include a mix of statistical analysis, numerical modelling and field experiments. We are interested to hear from statistical modellers, numerical modellers or field ecologists who are competent with quantitative analysis (e.g. in R). The project’s emphasis is on modelling, but local field work is possible for interested candidates if we need to fill in specific knowledge gaps to complete the models. Candidates must have excellent communication skills and a strong track record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals.\nThe postdoc position is nominally for 2.5 years full-time at academic level A (PhD graduate level); however, these terms are currently flexible. Please get in touch for more information.\nFor the PhD position we are seeking someone interested in the study of threatened marine ecosystems, particularly seagrass meadows, and ecosystem management. Candidates may undertake field work or purely modelling/analytical based work. Candidates must be enthusiastic about the analysis of data and should be keen to learn the R program language if they do not already have skills in this area.\nAustralian Resident applicants to Griffith’s PhD program should have received Honours 1 or equivalent. A lead authored publication in a peer-reviewed journal will be helpful.\nInternational applicants to Griffith’s PhD program must have led at least one peer-reviewed paper in an internationally recognised journal.\nDetails on the application process to a PhD at Griffith, including deadlines are here."

    "title": "Socially equitable recovery of fisheries",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Efforts to recover fisheries are often contentious. Recovering fisheries may cause economic hardship to fishers who have to reduce their catches in order to allow fish stocks to replenish.\n\nIn a new paper we explore how equitable distribution of catch restrictions across fishers may trade-off with fast and economically efficient recovery (open access pre-print here).\nIn 2004 Australia’s coral trout fishery, which operates in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, was reformed. These reforms were intended to increase the abundance of fish in the water for ecological reasons and also to increase the profitability of the fishery by making it easier to catch fish.\nReforms included reducing the number of licenses and increasing the area of the Great Barrier Reef marine park. The reforms were estimated to have cost government $250 million in assistance pay-outs to fishers and associated industries.\nIn part the cost blow-out has been attributed to perceptions of inequitable redistribution of catches.\nIn our new work, we asked if compromises must be made between the three goals of: (1) sharing catch restrictions ‘equitably’; (2) the abundance that fish stocks recover to; and (3) the fishery’s overall economic value.\nIt turned out that equitable distribution of catches led to fisheries that had either a lower overall value or lower abundance of fish than an approach that ignored equity and optimised overall profit. In other terms, equitable distributions are economically inefficient.\nHowever, the result hinged on two key assumptions.\nFirst, equitable distribution of catches was only inefficient if there were some individual fishers that made much more profits than others. For instance, some fishers may be more effective at finding the right times and places to go fishing, so can catch the same amount of fish at a lower cost.\nWhen this was the case, the most profitable fishery could be achieved if we shut the fishery to those fishers who spend more to catch the same amount of fish.\nClearly, shutting down some individuals in not very equitable.\nDetermining how much individuals vary in their fishing efficient is therefore important. When reforming fisheries with greater variability there will be stronger compromises between total profits and equity.\nA second key assumption was how we defined ‘equity’. You could define equitable restrictions in terms of everyone reducing their catches by an equal amount, or reducing them in proportion to their historical catches.\nGreater restrictions were less equitable if we measured equity as a proportion of an individual’s historic catches, whereas greater restrictions were more equitable if we measured equity as the total amount of catch.\nFor any given fishery it is therefore important to determine what type of equity matters most to the fishers that participate it. Finding a consensus on equity will be important to determine if the redistribution of catches is equitable.\nIn most fisheries reforms managers do not decide directly who gets to catch what post-reform. Instead, they may often offer voluntary buy-backs of fishing effort on a market to encourage fishers to reduce their effort. Our results could ultimately inform how such markets could be designed to be more equitable.\nOur results also suggest expectations for marked improvements in profits when recovering fisheries should be tempered, because often such solutions rely on the inequitable redistribution of catches. Ultimately, reforms that are percieved as being more just to fishers may be more likely to obtain political support and be successful in the long-term."

An easy way to compare them is to fit splines to each time-series and then just plot them next to each other, with SEs. Then we can compare visually for ‘signficant’ differences.\nHere’s some code to simulate three made-up series. The first two have the same trend, but different observation errors, the third has a different trend:\ntmax &lt;- 50\ndrift &lt;- c(10, -5)\nsd &lt;- 40\nsdobs &lt;- 200\nset.seed(5)\nyzero &lt;-  cumsum(rnorm(n=tmax, mean=drift[1], sd=sd))\ny1 &lt;- yzero + rnorm(n = tmax, mean = 0, sd = sdobs)\ny2 &lt;- yzero + rnorm(n = tmax, mean = 0, sd = sdobs)\ny3 &lt;- cumsum(rnorm(n=tmax, mean=drift[2], sd=sd)) +\n  rnorm(n = tmax, mean = 0, sd = sdobs)\ndat &lt;- data.frame(ts = rep(letters[1:3], each = tmax), x = rep(1:tmax, 3), y = c(y1, y2, y3))\nWe can easily plot these three series using ggplot2 and automatically add a spline.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_grid(.~ts) +\n    stat_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE) +\n   theme(axis.text = element_text(size=14),\n        axis.title = element_text(size=16,face=\"bold\"),\n          strip.text.x = element_text(size = 16),\n          panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', colour = 'white'))"

For instance, just like excel plots dont:\nx &lt;- rnorm(100)\ndat &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = 0.25*x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.2))\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_excel() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\nYou can get additional themes for ggplot2 using this excellent package. A cleaner view:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_base() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\nOr simply:\nplot(dat$x, dat$y, xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"y\", las = 1)\n\nA good principle is to not use ‘ink’ on figures that isn’t needed to communicate your message. Tufte takes the ‘less ink’ philosophy to the extreme:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() +\n    theme_tufte() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=20))\n\n\n\nWhen is ggplot2 appropriate, or when should I use base R?\nIn general I think ggplot2 is appropriate for problems of intermediate complexity. Like this:\n Base R is great if you just want to plot a barplot quickly, or do an x-y plot. ggplot2 comes into its own for slight more complex plots, like having multiple panels for different groups or colouring lines by a 3rd factor. But once you move to really complex plots, like overlaying a subplot on a map, ggplot2 becomes very difficult, if not impossible. At that point it is better to move back to Base R. ggplot2 can also get very fiddly if you are very specific about your plots, like having certain colours, or the labels in a certain way.\nAs an example, ggplot2 is great for data like this:\nx1 &lt;- rnorm(30)\ngrps &lt;- letters[c(rep(1, 10), rep(2, 10), rep(3, 10))]\ny1 &lt;- x1 + c(rep(1, 10), rep(-1, 10), rep(2, 10)) + rnorm(30)\ndat &lt;- data.frame(x = x1, grps = grps, y = y1)\nhead(dat)\n\n##             x grps             y\n## 1  0.19033984    a  6.159889e-01\n## 2 -0.07173877    a -7.577584e-05\n## 3 -0.00285171    a -1.003277e+00\n## 4 -1.10821896    a -7.302877e-01\n## 5  0.93519177    a  2.662337e+00\n## 6 -1.48583945    a -1.588023e+00\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x1, y = y1, color = grps)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw()\n\nIt is also pretty handy for faceting:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() + facet_wrap(~grps)+\n  theme_bw()\n\nThe key with ggplot2 is to have your data in a data-frame.\nIn reality both ggplot2 and base R graphics are worth learning, but I would start with learning the basics of base R graphics and then move onto ggplot2 if you want to quickly plot lots of structured data-sets.\n\n\nPie graphs vs bar graphs\nIn Mariani et al. they plot rates of seafood fraud by several European countries. While its a foundational study that establishes improvement in the accuracy of food labelling, their graphics could be improved in several ways.\nFirst they use perspective pies. This makes it incredibly hard to compare the two groups (fish that are labelled/mislabelled). Humans are very bad at comparing angles and pretty bad at comparing areas. With the perspective you can’t even compare the areas properly. They do provide the raw numbers, but then, why bother with the pies? Note that the % pies misrepresent the data slightly because the % figures are actually odds ratios (mis-labels / correct labels), rather than percent (mis-labeels / total samples). Second the pies are coloured red/green, which will be hard for red-green colourblind people to see. Third, they have coloured land blue on their map, so it appears to be ocean at first look. Fourth, the map is not really neccessary. There are no spatial patterns going on that the authors want to draw attention to. I guess having a map does emphasize that the study is in Europe. Finally, the size of each pie is scaled to the sample size, but the scale bar for the sample size shows a sample of only 30, whereas most of their data are for much larger samples sizes (&gt;200). Do you get the impression from the pies that the UK has 668 samples, whereas Ireland only has 187? Therefore, from this graphic we have no idea what sample size was used in each country.\nIn fact, all the numbers that are difficult to interpret in the figure are very nicely presented in Table 1.\nBelow is a start at improving the presentation. For instance, you could do a simple bar chart, ordering by rate of mislabelling.\ncnames &lt;- c('Ireland' ,'UK','Germany','France','Spain','Portugal')\ncorrlab &lt;- c(180, 647, 145, 146, 267, 178)\nmislab &lt;- c(7, 21, 9, 4, 24, 12)\nmisrate &lt;- 100*signif(mislab / (corrlab + mislab),2)\ncorrrate &lt;- 100 - misrate\nord &lt;- order(misrate, decreasing = T)\ny &lt;- rbind(corrrate, misrate)\n\npar(mar = c(5,4,4,7))\nbarplot(y[,ord], names.arg = cnames[ord], col = c('skyblue','tomato'), ylab = 'Labelling rate (%)', las = 2)\nlegend(x=7.5, y = 90, legend = c(\"Mislabelled\", \"Correctly labelled\"), pch = 16, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), xpd = NA, cex = 0.7)\n\nYou could add another subfigure to this, showing the rate by different species too.\nThe barplot doesn’t communicate the sample size, but then that is probably not the main point. The sample sizes are probably best reported in the table\nIf we felt the map was essential, then putting barcharts on it would be more informative. It is not that easy to add barcharts ontop of an existing map in R, so I would recommend creating the barcharts seperately, then adding them on in Illustrator or Powerpoint.\nWe can make a basic map like this:\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(maptools)\nmap('world', xlim = c(-20, 20), ylim = c(35, 60), col = 'grey', fill = T)\n\nThen create some nice barcharts. We write a loop so we get one barchart for each country.\nnc &lt;- length(cnames)\npar(mfrow = c(2,3), oma = c(1,1,1,3))\nfor (i in 1:nc){\n  y &lt;- c(mislab[i], corrlab[i])\n  barplot(y, names.arg = '', las = 2, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), ylim = c(0, corrlab[i]), main = cnames[i], cex.main = 2.4, yaxt = 'n')\n  byy &lt;- signif(max(y),2)/3\n  yat &lt;- c(0, min(y), max(y))\naxis(2, at = yat, las = 2, cex.axis = 2, labels = F)\naxis(2, at = yat[2:3], las = 2, cex.axis = 2, labels = T)\n}\nlegend(x = 2.8, y = 500, legend = c('Fraud', 'Correct'), pch = 15, col = c('tomato','skyblue'), xpd = NA, cex = 2, bty = 'n')\n\n\n\nScaling matters\nIt can be misleading to present % and proportion data on axes that are not scaled 0 - 100%. For instance, compare these three graphs:\ny &lt;- c(70, 72, 68, 73)\nx &lt;- 1:4\nxnams &lt;- LETTERS[1:4]\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,3), oma = c(1,1,1,3), mar = c(5,6,2,2))\nplot(x,y, pch = 3, cex = 2, las = 1, xaxt  = 'n', xlab = '', ylab = 'Percent', cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, tcl = 0.5, xlim = c(0, 5), col = 'red', lwd = 3)\naxis(1, at = x, labels = xnams, cex.axis = 2, tcl = 0.5)\n\nbarplot(y, names.arg = xnams, las = 1, cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.names = 2, ylab = 'Percent')\n\nbarplot(y, names.arg = xnams, las = 1, cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.names = 2, ylab = 'Percent', ylim = c(0, 100))"

    "text": "Choosing colour scales\nAlot of thought should go into choosing colour scales for graphs for instance- will it print ok? will colour blind people be able to see this? does the scale create artificial visual breaks in the data? Luckily there is a package to help you make the right decision for a colour scale, it is called RColorBrewer. Check out colorbrewer.org for a helpful interactive web interface for choosing colours.\nFirst let’s load some sea surface temperature data as a raster:\nlibrary(raster)\nr &lt;- raster(\"MeanAVHRRSST\")\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(r, col = rev(brewer.pal(11, \"Spectral\")), asp = NA)\nplot(r, col = brewer.pal(11, \"Purples\"), asp = NA)\n\n## Warning in brewer.pal(11, \"Purples\"): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Purples is 9\n## Returning the palette you asked for with that many colors\n\nUsing red-green palettes makes it hard for colour blind people. Also, using a diverging palette makes it look like there is something important about the middle point (yellow). A better palette to use would be one of the sequential ones, “Purples” shown here.\nTo make it easier to understand, let’s look at these again as contour plots. I will use a more appropriate diverging palette to the red-green one though.\nz &lt;- matrix(rep(1:10, 10), nrow = 10)\nfilled.contour(z, col = brewer.pal(9, 'Reds'), nlevels = 10)\n\nfilled.contour(z, col = brewer.pal(9, 'RdBu'), nlevels = 10)\n\nNotice the diverging pallette creates an artificial split at yellow\nOne of the only legitimate uses for pie graphs (I think) is visualising the colour scales. Here is how:\nreds &lt;- brewer.pal(9, 'Reds')\ngreens &lt;- brewer.pal(9, 'Greens')\nblues &lt;- brewer.pal(9, 'Blues')\nrdylgn &lt;- brewer.pal(9, 'RdYlGn')\nrdbu &lt;- brewer.pal(9, 'RdBu')\ndark2 &lt;- brewer.pal(8, 'Dark2')\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,3), mar = c(0,0,0,0), oma = c(0,0,0,0))\npie(rep(1, 9), col = reds)\npie(rep(1, 9), col = greens)\npie(rep(1, 9), col = blues)\npie(rep(1, 9), col = rdylgn)\npie(rep(1, 9), col = rdbu)\npie(rep(1, 9), col = dark2)"

One example is our work in the Solomon Islands.\nThe Solomon Islands is home to globally significant sea turtle populations, yet faces mounting conservation challenges. Our research has provided insights into how fisheries and protected areas impact these endangered species—and how science can drive real-world change.\nA national-scale study estimated that ~12,000 turtles were caught in 2018, with up to 97% harvested in small-scale coastal fisheries (SSFs). Surprisingly, these fisheries, often overlooked by international funders, pose a greater threat to turtles than industrial scale longline bycatch. Community-based monitoring revealed that green turtles dominate catches, and harvest rates have declined 4.9-fold over 30 years—clear signs of overfishing. These findings shaped the Solomon Islands’ National Plan of Action for Marine Turtles (2023–2027), emphasizing sustainable SSF management.\nIn parallel, satellite tracking of 30 nesting hawksbill turtles in the Arnavon Community Marine Park (ACMP) showed that 98.5% remained within park boundaries during nesting, validating its design. Early results led to ACMP’s declaration as the nation’s first national park in 2017. Tracking also exposed poaching hotspots, prompting the establishment of a new ranger station.\n\n\n\nImage: Migration of hawksbill turtles from the Solomon Islands\n\n\nTogether, these projects highlight how community-driven science can rapidly inform policy and protect endangered wildlife."

    "text": "We are entering a new era of science where ecosystem change is uncharted by historical observations. Observations are the foundation of predictive science, so how can we predict a future that is outside the envelope of the environments?\nThis is the question I am addressing in a 2021 Australian Research Council Future Fellowship. Specifically, I will focus on predicting future change for coastal ecosystems.\nWatch a short video about the project\nHumanities footprint on the Earth’s ecosystem has never been greater. The oceans are increasingly being industrialized, and climate change means the footprint of human economic activity now touches even the most remote ecosystems.\nCoastal ecosystems exemplify the challenges we face in managing our growing impacts. Coasts are the thin line on which much of the human population and industrial activity rests. This human activity places great pressures on coastal ecosystems, and in many places, we are losing species and the ecological functions that support human livelihoods, like fisheries.\nPredicting the future for coastal ecosystems is critical for creating a sustainable relationship between humanity and nature. Ecological predictions allow us to identify options for better managing our relationship with ecosystems.\nReliable predictions are needed to help managers mitigate the risks of future human activities to the environment. In this four-year fellowship I will lead a team to develop new modelling techniques for predicting ecosystem change.\nA couple of key research outputs to date\nIn Assessing predictive accuracy of species abundance models in dynamic systems (published Methods in Ecology and Evolution 2025) I show how we can validate models in rapidly changing environments. We show that the quality of prediction degrades (and errors get bigger) in ecosystems that are undergoing rapid change from climate change and invasive species.\nIn Projecting Uncertainty in Ecosystem Persistence Under Climate Change (published Global Change Biology 2025) we developed a method to estimate probabilities of mangrove persistence using global datasets. This gives us a way to measure uncertainty that we can use to guide conservation decisions, e.g. to identify where management actions are most likely to succeed. This research shows a new way to handle ecosystem predictions under climate change. Instead of false precision, we quantify what we know and don’t know. For mangroves, significant seaward losses are likely, but landward gains and conservation success remain possible with strategic action. R"

    "text": "If you ask someone who the intended audience for their paper is they will often say ‘managers’.\nIts often said that managers don’t read papers, but that’s not quite try. Its more helpful to think about a hierarchy of ways our published research can impact management. This will help you tailor the message, and communications outputs to different audiences.\nThree tiers of audience to think about for your paper to reach managers: (1) managers and their (non-scientific) advisors; (2) scientific advisors of managers; (3) scientists working on this topic.\nI’m going to use my recent study on timelines for ecosystem recovery as an example. The intended audience was primarily researchers, but the findings also have implications for management.\nIn brief, found that recovery times for coastal habitats are often longer and more variable than might be expected. This means when you try to restore a coastal habitat, it might not happen right away. However, appropriate management interventions can significantly accelerate the recovery process."

    "text": "1. Managers and their non-science advisors\nManagement roles are as diverse as scientific disciplines, so its better to think about the type of manager you’d like to influence, rather than just ‘managers’ as a homogenous category.\nThen think about what decisions the managers are making. The decisions managers make are varied. Conservation research is often about informing where or how managers act. But the there are many smaller decisions that are made along the way.\nFor instance, we looked at what types of restoration actions (planting seagrass vs stabilising sediments to improve seagrass recruitment) are best under what circumstances. The type of restoration is a relatively big decision that maybe can be made once and not easily changed.\nThere are many other smaller decisions. For example, our estimations of recovery times could influence how communication about conservation is made. It is important to set expectations about recovery and not to over-promise.\nLikewise, managers are often making decisions about how to allocate budgets and resources. So for our research, an implication could be how managers allocate resources to improving restoration actions versus identifying the drivers of ecosystem loss.\nManagers are unlikely to read your paper directly (with some exceptions I’ll detail below). So if managers are the audience for your research, you’ll need to do some additional communication. This could be via media releases, or better yet, presenting to managers at management forums, or collaborating directly with them.\nIn my experience many conservation managers are reading papers, and in fact, study science or even used to be scientists. These people may make the time to read your paper if its direclty relevant them and it helps to email it to them as well.\nFor examples, decisions makers in non-governmental organisations often have a scientific background. The types of decisions they might be making are how to allocate project budgets among monitoring, implementation and community engagement and what types of activities to chase funding for.\nIt helps if you are already collaborating with your target audience, so that you can better understand their needs."

    "text": "2. Scientific advisors to managers\nScientific advisors to managers can also be varied. For exmample, they might be academics who collaborate with managers or government scientists.\nThis target audience is more likely to read your paper and understand more of the technical details. In our study on recovery times we suggested the new models we developed could be applied to any coastal habitat restoration to provide estimates of recovery times.\nSo the decisions this group of people might be making include: what should we focus on in our research and what methods should we use? Think about how you can influence those decisions.\nOf course they need to know about your paper first. So the usual things of emailing people, doing social media and presenting at conferences are important.\nThe audience of scientists advising managers is the one most able to be able to implement the technics we described and directly use the research. In my case, that would mean using the R code we provided that implements the methods we described.\nCommunication to this audience is best via direct contact or presenting and meeting people at conferences. You are more likely to meet these types of people if you target discipline and region specific conferences where your research has greatest direct relevance. At big international conferences the audience will be more interested in the general conclusions."

Things this group does (and there may be overlap) will hopefully influence upwards to levels 2 and 3.\nSo by raising the bar on your research topic you may still ultimately be contributing to management. It’s just going to take longer and the specific impact of your paper on management will be harder to trace.\nYou can tailor your communciations about the paper appropriately. For instance, international conferences are a good opportunity to meet researchers and talk about the general implications of your research for the field."

It helps to think about the audience in advance so you can tailor your paper and communications in advance. In particular, it will affect how you write your abstract (do you mention management implications or not) and where you put your effort for communications and engagement.\nSo when you say ‘I want my paper to impact management’ think about who these people are and what decisions they are making. You don’t have to reach managers directly to have an impact on management."

    "text": "We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow in Aquatic Ecology to work on wetlands science and environmental accounting. The person will be supervised by Dr Chris Brown and work with Dr Mark Kennard and Professor Rod Connolly to bring together two projects. This is a 2 year position.\nApplications close 30th July. Apply here, read more below or in the position description (links to a pdf).\nThe Project\nThis project will develop an economic-environmental accounting approach that will provide clear performance metrics to help inform development and conservation of aquatic habitats. The environmental accounts will help inform water planning and management of coastal wetland ecosystems. The project partners two major programs run by the Australian Rivers Institute. The first, is a consortium of organisations, including the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University, who are involved in research under the National Environmental Science Program (NESP) Northern Australia Environmental Resources Hub. NESP Hub partners undertake research to support sustainable development of Australia’s unique northern environments. The Australian Rivers Institute is currently running two complementary projects through the NESP Hub on environmental economic accounting and environmental flow management in northern Australia’s river catchments.\nThe second program is the new Global Wetlands research program, which is developing and applying globally applicable assessments of coastal wetland health to drive actions and investments towards protection, restoration and improvement of coastal wetlands worldwide. Coastal wetlands – mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh – are valuable ecosystems with high biodiversity. However as the world’s coastal cities continue to grow and industrialise, many coastal wetlands are facing major declines in ecosystem health.\nTo accomplish the programs’ objectives, the Institute is recruiting a research fellow who has a productive publication record and is skilled in the synthesis of ecological data. The research fellow will synthesise existing research on environmental flows and wetland health in Northern Australia. They will use the synthesis to inform a new approach to economic-environmental accounting, developed in collaboration with a team that includes economists and social scientists. Finally, they will work with the GIS experts in the Global Wetlands program to apply the accounting approach to report on the health of coastal wetlands at a global scale.\nThis is an opportunity to be part of major initiatives promoting the health of key aquatic ecosystems. The research fellow will work in a supportive team with complementary skills in ecology, economics, social science, statistical modelling, big data, and science communication.\nThe Role\nThe Postdoctoral Research Fellow will work closely with project Chief Investigators and colleagues in the Australian Rivers Institute. The Postdoctoral Research Fellow will be required to actively contribute to these research projects, and as a member of the Australian Rivers Institute, to broader Institute activities. The role will require high level skills in aquatic ecology, data analysis, stakeholder engagement and communications writing. This is a 2 year, full time position, located at either the Gold Coast or Nathan campuses, however flexible working arrangements may be negotiated.\nThe person\nThe successful applicant will have completed a PhD in aquatic ecology, have demonstrated skills in synthesis of ecological data and be enthusiastic about interdisciplinary collaboration. They will have published lead authored papers in esteemed journals, and have excellent interpersonal and communication skills with the ability to work effectively within a team.\nGriffith University values gender equality, diversity and inclusion and is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to persons from all backgrounds and identities. It offers a supportive and flexible working environment with excellent working conditions. For further information follow this link.\nAll applications must be submitted online.\nFor further information about this role, please contact Dr Chris Brown, email chris.brown@griffith.edu.au.\nFor application queries, please contact Ms Kaitlin Reents, HR Officer on +61 (0) 7 3735 6614."

Consistency will make it easy to write programs for post-processing. Another application is processing satellite images. For instance, I recently wanted to summarise water quality measurements for Fiji and had over 100 images over the space of several years.\nHere is a quick how to for summarising data from multiple files using R. Note that R is not the fastest program for these kind of operations. So if you have really big data frames, you might want to investigate using Python.\nFirst, you want to get all you files into one folder. Or at least, into sub-folders of one folder.

The second frames the study as being about studying an under-studied mechanism.\nThe experiment started with a project folder with data and detailed instructions for the research question, the data and the analyses I wanted. The instructions included details of R packages and specific statistics, for instance I told the model to use Bray-Curtis distances for the multivariate analysis.\nI also provided basic instructions for how to write the paper. The agent had web search capabilities, allowing it to access , and read real references, and then incorporate insights from those into the paper.\nIt is important to note that this draft has not been edited by a human. Parts of it are not scientifically accurate. It should not be read as anything other than an experiment. It contains errors and some of the references are false.\nFor instance, it made up the following reference, but oddly linked it to a real reference (that is different) using a real DOI:\nHamilton, Richard J et al. 2025. “Modeling Sediment Impacts on Juvenile Reef Fish.” Frontiers in Marine Science. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2025.1513498.\nIt didn’t make much of an effort to create good instructions for writing a paper.

We examined benthic community composition at 49 coral reef sites across a gradient of logging impacts in Kia Province, Solomon Islands, spanning distances from 0.20 to 22.4 km from logging operations. Using multidimensional scaling ordination and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we tested for differences in community structure between logged and not logged sites and across distance categories. Benthic communities differed significantly between logged and not logged sites (PERMANOVA p = 0.027), with logged sites showing 14.2% lower coral cover (48.0% vs 62.2%). Distance-dependent effects were highly significant (p = 0.002), explaining 11.9% of community variance. Sites within 1 km of logging showed severely degraded conditions (31.2% coral cover, 33.3% sand cover), while sites beyond 10 km maintained high coral cover (62.9%). Recovery followed a clear gradient: moderate distance sites (1-3 km) had 55.3% coral cover, far sites (3-10 km) had 60.4% coral cover. Categorical distance analysis proved more informative than continuous distance relationships, indicating threshold effects rather than linear gradients. These findings demonstrate that logging impacts extend further than previously documented, with measurable effects at sites 1-3 km from operations. Our results provide quantitative evidence for establishing buffer zones around coral reefs and highlight the need for watershed-scale conservation planning that integrates terrestrial forest management with marine protected area design."

This study examined benthic community structure across 49 coral reef sites in the Solomon Islands using multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination to test the hypothesis that logging activities influence reef community composition through sedimentation. We applied non-metric multidimensional scaling to benthic cover data using both Euclidean and Bray-Curtis distance metrics, with environmental vector fitting to identify ecological gradients. The analysis revealed strong community gradients primarily associated with coral branching cover (r² = 0.82) and soft coral cover (r² = 0.62), while water clarity showed moderate correlation (r² = 0.24) with community structure. Contrary to expectations, distance to logging showed weak correlation with community patterns (r² = 0.056, p = 0.101), suggesting that logging impacts operate through pathways not captured by simple proximity measures. The results demonstrate MDS ordination effectiveness for revealing coral community structure patterns while highlighting the complexity of logging-reef relationships in tropical marine systems."

    "title": "What are conservation priorities?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How should we identify priorities for conservation of biodiversity?\n\n\nMaps of ‘priorities’ for conservation are popular product of conservation research. One approach is to make ‘hotspots’ maps of species richness, or rare species, or rare species that have low protection (e.g. Jenkins et al. 2015 PNAS). However, such approaches defy decades of research on conservation planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to PNAS we explain why hotspots maps of species are not maps of conservation priorities. In fact, calling a map of species richness a map of priorities has been called one of the six common mistakes in conservation planning. Our letter was a reponse to Jenkins et al. 2015, and has created some controversy.\n\n\nFirst, everyone from CEOs to life-coaches knows that a succesful agenda requires clear objectives. Without clear objectives, we waste time and money because efforts are not coordinated. Conservation planning is no different.\n\n\nSecond, conservation plans should prioritise actions. Setting a clear objective helps us to define the actions we need to take to save biodiversity. If actions are not prioritised, mistakes can occur, for instance, different actions like conservation easments and setting up protected areas can have very different costs and feasibilities. The implicit assumption when researchers talk about prioritising places is that they are talking about protected areas as the action. If that is the case, then they should be explicit. There are many other actions that can be taken to protect species.\n\n\nThird, conservation actions are constrained by economic, social and political factors. At least some of these constraints should be accounted for when prioritising actions.\n\n\nFinally, if conservation aims to protect multiple species, we need to consider how those species are represented across different protected areas. An issue that was first discovered way back in 1983. A map of species richness, may identify two hotspots, but if those hotspots contain the same species, then protecting both of them will not represent all the species in a landscape in the protected areas.\n\n\nThe Jenkins et al. paper, which attempts to set conservation priorities for US protected lands provides a good example of why ‘hotspots’ approaches are dangerous. A previous analysis, but other authors, that did consider constraints to conservation found considerably different priorities for protection in the US.\n\n\nA better way\n\n\nWe recently asked how actions to conserve seagrass in the Mediterranean should be prioritised. We considered several actions, including avoiding areas with high coastal development (it was not considered politically feasible to revert coastal development); placing reefs to prevent illegal trawling on seagrass; and placing moorings to prevent yachts from dropping anchor on seagrass. Importantly, we considered the spatial distribution of seagrass, the distribution of threats to seagrass and the cost of stopping the threats. We were able to identify priorities places for each of these actions. It turned out that placing artificial reefs in the best seagrass meadows, despite their high cost, were the most cost-effective way to save seagrass.\n\n\n  \n\n\nWe also compared other approaches to prioritising actions, like prioritising actions in places with the greatest human impacts, and prioritising actions in places that had the most seagrass. We found that not considering the cost of actions could result in plans that were more than two times as costly as the plan that did consider costs (see figure). The plans that used only human impacts or seagrass cover to prioritise actions wasted resources in places that were either not threatened, or should be avoided because of coastal development impacts.\n\nMore details:\n\n\nUsing threat maps for cost-effective prioritization of actions to conserve coastal habitats (2015) S Giakoumi, CJ Brown, S Katsanevakis, M Saunders, HP Possingham Marine Policy 61 \n\n\nEffective conservation requires clear objectives and prioritizing actions, not places or species (in press) CJ Brown, M Bode, O Venter, MD Barnes, J McGowan, CA Runge, JEM Watson, HP Possingham PNAS online early"

Someone said I should share it here.\nDear team,\nWe have never faced as much uncertainty in our lives, careers and economy as we do right now. The decisions we make now, even small decisions, will have repercussions possibly for years to come. But there is no way knowing what the ‘best’ decision is. We are faced with a dilemma, a dilemma that forces us to act without knowing the right way forward.\nI am writing this message to help you respond to this uncertainty. All of you have the abilities to respond and the strength to do so. As a team we also have great strength to face this challenge.\nWe’ll start at the most immediate decisions and then think about how the uncertainty affects longer term decisions."

The outcome doesn’t look good if we continue as we are.\nEpidemiologists can also predict well what will happen with mild, moderate or drastic interventions, such as closing schools or banning face to face interaction.\nRecent modelling for the US suggests that a very strict lockdown of 1.5 years is needed to avoid massive fatalities and a broken health system. This will give time for a vaccine to be developed and a vaccination program implemented. If we go down this path, but change our minds before the vaccine, the pandemic will come back, as bad as ever.\nThe greatest uncertainty is in human behaviour and politics. We don’t know how society and our government will react once they see the hospital system overwhelmed and the deaths mounting. If they do start a lockdown, we don’t know if they can maintain it for long enough.\nWe also don’t know how either scenario would play out for the economy or for science careers."

For now this decision is yours, until the government makes it for us.\nIf you decide to keep going out, know that the risk of infection is high, very high. Soon it may be impossible to avoid.

You will get sick and we hope, recover with a stronger immune system.\nAlso know that this decision does impact others. You will be contributing to the spread of the disease in our community. So please be extreme in your hygiene and stay away from vulnerable groups if this is the decision you make.\nIf you decide to stay home, know that it will be a long haul. Months, maybe more than a year. You can change your mind later about this of course (unless it becomes illegal), so staying home now will keep your options open to some degree.\nIf you are sick or exposed to someone who is, of course, please stay home for at least 2 weeks.\nWhatever you do BE SAFE. Be 1000x more cautious than your normally are. Whether its driving, working around the house, or exercising.

If you get the chance, gather data to test alternate future decisions. This could be very local, such as finding out which suburbs are safer to shop in. Or it could be longer term, like trying different routines at home for keeping fit.\nAs change is rapid right now, it is easy to get caught in making moment-by-moment decisions. Give yourself time to think one or two steps ahead. For instance, while everyone else is wondering if there will be a lockdown, get prepared for the possibility of being home a lot. While everyone else is wondering if they will lose casual jobs, ask yourself what casual job might have increased demand right now.\nClear communication with those around you is also important. That means your friends, local community and colleagues. Starting to feel sick? Then let your colleagues know you may be out of action for a while, as well as warning those you’ve seen recently."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In our new study we predict the timescales of recovery for seagrass meadows after a disturbance. We found that recovery times are often longer and more variable than might be expected. However, appropriate management interventions can significantly accelerate the recovery process.\nOur modelling approach could be applied to any coastal habitat, including coral reefs, kelp forests, salt marsh and mangrove forests. In can inform on expected timescales of recovery and optimal restoration actions. We designed the model because we noticed how marine protected area science had benefited from models that predicted the recovery of fish populations. We wanted to develop a similar modelling basis for coastal habitat restoration.\n\nHere’s an FAQ for the study, generated from the study by Google Notebook and edited and verified for accuracy by me.\n\nWhat factors influence the recovery time of coastal habitats?\n\nThe recovery time of coastal habitats, such as seagrass meadows, coral reefs, and mangrove forests, is influenced by several factors:\nConnectivity: The presence of nearby healthy habitat patches that can act as propagule (seeds, larvae, dislodged shoots) sources is crucial. Higher connectivity generally leads to faster recovery.\nDispersal: The ability of propagules to successfully travel from source habitats to the disturbed area. Dispersal is affected by factors like currents, winds, and the dispersal mechanisms of the species.\nRecruitment: The successful establishment of dispersed propagules in the disturbed area. Recruitment depends on suitable environmental conditions, such as sediment stability, light availability, and water quality.\nGrowth rate: The inherent growth rate of the species influences how quickly it can repopulate the area.\nChronic stressors: Ongoing pressures like pollution or low light conditions can significantly hinder recovery.\n\nHow does the model in the study predict recovery times?\n\nThe study developed a mathematical model that simulates the recovery of coastal habitats. It incorporates:\nHabitat patches: Represents the disturbed area and nearby remnant habitats as interconnected patches.\nPropagule production: Estimates the amount of propagules produced by each remnant patch based on its size and condition.\nDispersal and recruitment: Models the probability of propagules successfully dispersing and recruiting to the disturbed patch, considering connectivity, dispersal limitations, and environmental conditions.\nGrowth: Uses a growth function (e.g., logistic growth for seagrass) to simulate habitat regeneration in the disturbed patch based on factors like light availability and species-specific growth rates.\nThe model runs simulations with different parameter combinations to predict recovery times and evaluate the effectiveness of various management interventions.\n\nWhat management interventions can accelerate the recovery of coastal habitats?\n\nThe study highlights three key management interventions:\nSpreading propagules or planting seedlings: Directly increases propagule supply to overcome dispersal limitations, particularly in isolated areas.\nStabilizing recruitment conditions: Addresses recruitment limitations by creating more favorable conditions for propagule establishment, such as using biodegradable structures to stabilize sediments or improve substrate.\nMitigating chronic stressors: Improves overall ecosystem health and enhances both dispersal and recruitment by addressing factors like pollution, nutrient loading, or low light conditions.\nThe most effective intervention depends on the specific context and the dominant limitations to recovery.\n\nWhy is it important to understand the difference between dispersal and recruitment limitations?\n\nDistinguishing between dispersal and recruitment limitations is crucial for effective management:\nDispersal limitation: Occurs when propagules don’t reach the disturbed area due to limited connectivity or inefficient dispersal mechanisms. Solution: Focus on interventions that enhance propagule supply, like seeding or planting.\nRecruitment limitation: Arises when propagules reach the disturbed area but fail to establish due to unfavorable environmental conditions. Solution: Prioritize interventions that improve local conditions, such as stabilizing sediments or improving water quality.\nIdentifying the dominant limitation helps target restoration efforts for the fastest recovery times and greatest rates of success.\n\nHow does low light stress affect the recovery of coastal habitats?\n\nLow light stress, often caused by pollution or turbidity, significantly hinders recovery by:\nReducing growth: Limits the photosynthetic ability of habitat-forming species, slowing down their growth and expansion.\nIncreasing recovery time: Extends the time it takes for the disturbed area to regain its functionality and ecological value.\nReduces propagule supply: Low light conditions can limit the production of propagules in remnant habitats, further impeding recovery.\nAddressing low light conditions, often through catchment management to improve water quality, is crucial for successful restoration, especially in light-limited environments.\n\nHow can this research inform the future of coastal habitat restoration?\n\nThis study provides a valuable framework for:\nIdentifying recovery bottlenecks: By understanding the factors limiting recovery (dispersal, recruitment, growth), managers can prioritize appropriate interventions.\nPredicting recovery timelines: The model offers estimates of recovery times, helping set realistic expectations and inform adaptive management strategies.\nOptimizing restoration efforts: Simulating different management scenarios can identify the most effective approach for specific contexts and maximize restoration success.\nBy combining ecological understanding with modeling tools, this research paves the way for more efficient and successful coastal habitat restoration efforts globally.\nBrown CJ, Campbell MD, Collier CJ, Turschwell MP, Saunders MI, Connolly RM. 2024 Speeding up the recovery of coastal habitats through management interventions that address constraints on dispersal and recruitment.

    "text": "By Dr Mischa Turschwell, Research Fellow\nThanks to the Australian Society for Fish Biology, I had the privilege of attending Science Meets Parliament earlier this year. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 my hopes of a chance in-person encounter with a famous politician were dashed, but nonetheless Science Meets Parliament 2022 still managed to deliver an action packed week of virtual presentations, workshops and masterclasses. As per the name of the event, the majority of activities focussed on how we—as scientists—can better engage with decision makers. I got to hear from physics whizzes Professor Brian Cox and Kirsten Banks, as well as Nobel prize winning immunologist Professor Peter Doherty.\nThe real kicker was having the opportunity to have an hour-long meeting with a Minister. I was paired with Nationals senate whip, Senator Perin Davey who was genuinely interested in my science. We discussed the challenges of environmental watering in the Murray-Darling Basin, and spoke about some of the cool science and technology emerging in Australian waters through the Blue Economy CRC. Senator Davey gave me some great advice on how to engage with MPs and senior decision makers. Here are a few of the top tips:\nKeep it simple. Remember, a lot of parliamentarians don’t have a scientific background so keep the terminology simple and only discuss 1-3 points. Keep any written pitch to 1 page and always make sure you have the evidence to back up your claims.\nFocus on the solution. A large majority of the time when scientists get the chance meet decision makers or politicians, they focus on asking for/complaining about a lack of funding. Turn the tables and instead focus on pitching your expertise as solution to a problem (then hopefully the funding will flow!).\nBe respectfully persistent. Pollies are a busy bunch. If they haven’t responded to you, it’s probably slipped their mind. They will not mind if you follow up and persevere with your enquiry, just make sure you engage in a respectful manner. The old saying goes, ‘persistence pays off’. Localise the issue. Can you translate what your science means in a local context? What does it mean for their electorate? Make your pitch personally relatable as having a vote attached can be hugely influential.\nDifferentiate key players (decision makers) from your target audience. We tend to focus on target audience (which of course is key for wider science communication), but often decision makers will need a different form of engagement (see points above about politicians being busy).\nAt the time of writing, I haven’t yet attended the Gala dinner but lucky for me that’s an in-person event so maybe I’ll get that chance encounter after all!"

    "text": "The problem with the priors\nIn our analysis, we focus on the use of stable isotopes to estimate the diet compositions of animals. Though the analysis of stable isotope ratios can equally well be applied to understanding nutrient and carbon flows in ecosystems, like in the pictured mangrove forest.\nOne of the most popular approaches for analysing isotope data are Bayesian mixing models. Bayesian mixing models account for variation in the isotopic signature of different potential food sources. This means we get estimates of proportional contribution of food items to a diet with associated uncertainty intervals.\nBayesian methods require specification of priors, which reflect our prior knowledge about what the animal consumes. The model then integrates the prior with the data to obtain the final estimates, termed posteriors.\nThe problem arises, because most ecologists use the ‘default’ prior, apparently without considering its effect on their posterior estimates of diet composition.\nIn many other settings Bayesian priors can be designed so they have only a weak influence on the posterior, this is not the case in mixing models. Take the image below. The blue probability distribution shows the ‘default’ priors for the contribution of each of three food items to a gull species’ diet.\n\nClearly the prior distribution is not totally uninformative. The prior has a mode near 10% and a mean of 1/3 (because their are three potential food sources).\nThe priors for a diet cannot in fact be totally flat across all proportions, simply because the sum across all proportions must equal 1. The plotted priors are in fact the ‘marginal’ priors, so they reflect the fact that there are more ways to add three numbers and get one when those numbers are near 1/3, than near 0 or 1.\nSo if you run an analysis with a small amount of data, or very noisy data, the result you get out will basically be the prior.\nThis means that any potential diet items thrown into the analysis, in case they matter, can come out with a mean contribution near 1/3 (or 1/ however many sources you had), leading researchers to the unexpected conclusion that unlikely diet items are suddenly very important."

This measures the divergence between prior and posterior, with values near zero indicating identical distributions and values near one indicating the posterior has positive probability everywhere the prior had zero probability (ie maximal divergence).\nAnother statistic is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which we also discuss in the paper.\nSo, if we have not learned much (ie the data are weak), then the Hellinger distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence will be near zero.\nThere are several ways we can get high information divergence, and a high value warrants further investigation.\nFor instance, the data may support the prior, in which case we have similar mean estimates for diet, but uncertainty about diets has decreased.\nOr the data may contradict the priors, in which case we have different mean estimates, or even the same mean with much greater uncertainty."

    "section": "",
    "text": "General linear models are one of the most widely used statistical tool in the biological sciences. This may be because they are so flexible and they can address many different problems, that they provide useful outputs about statistical significance AND effect sizes, or just that they are easy to run in many common statistical packages.\nThe maths underlying General Linear Models (and Generalized linear models, which are a related but different class of model) may seem mysterious to many, but are actually pretty accessible. You would have learned the basics in high school maths.\nWe will cover some of those basics here. You might like to read my blog on Genealized linear model link functions after this one.\n\n\nAs the name suggests General Linear Models rely on a linear equation, which in its basic form is simply:\nyi = α + βxi + ϵ*i\nThe equation for a straight line, with some error added on.\nIf you aren’t that familiar with mathematical notation, notice a few things about this equation (I have followed standard conventions here). I used normal characters for variables (i.e. things you measure) and Greek letters for parameters, which are estimated when you fit the model to the data.\nyi are your response data, I indexed the y with i to indicate that there are multiple observations. xi is variously known as a covariate, predictor variable or explanatory variable. α is an intercept that will be estimated. α has the same units as y. (e.g. if y is number of animals, then α is expected the number of animals when x = 0).\nβ is a slope parameter that will also be estimated. β is also termed the effect size because it measures the effect of x on y. β has units of ‘y per x’. For instance, if x is temperature, then β has units of number of animals per degree C. β thus measures how much we expect y to change if x were to increase by 1.\nFinally, don’t forget ϵi, which is the error. ϵi will measure the distance between each prediction of yi made by the model and the observed value of yi.\nThese predictions will simply be calculated as:\nyi = α + βxi*\n(notice I just removed the ϵi from the end). You can think of the linear predictions as: the mean or ‘expected’ value a new observation yi would take if we only knew xi and also as the ‘line of best fit’.\n\n\n\nNow we know the model, we can generate some idealized data. Hopefully this will then give you a feel for how we can fit a model to data. Open up R and we will create these parameters:\nn &lt;- 100\nbeta &lt;- 2.2\nalpha &lt;- 30\nWhere n is the sample size and alpha and beta are as above.\nWe also need some covariate data, we will just generate a sequence of n numbers from 0 to 1:\nx &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out = n)\nThe model’s expectation is thus this straight line:\ny_true &lt;- beta * x + alpha\nplot(x, y_true)\n\nBecause we made the model up, we can say this is the true underlying relationship. Now we will add error to it and see if we can recover that relationship with a general linear model.\nLet’s generate some error:\nsigma &lt;- 2.4\nset.seed(42)\nerror &lt;- rnorm(n, sd = sigma)\ny_obs &lt;- y_true + error\nplot(x, y_obs)\nlines(x, y_true)\n\nHere sigma is our standard deviation, which measures how much the observations y vary around the true relationship. We then used rnorm to generate n random normal numbers, that we just add to our predicted line y_true to simulate observing this relationship.\nCongratulations, you just created a (modelled) reality a simulated an ecologist going out and measuring that reality.\nNote the set.seed() command. This just ensures the random number generator produces the same set of numbers every time it is run in R and it is good practice to use it (so your code is repeatable). Here is a great explanation of seed setting and why 42 is so popular.\nAlso, check out the errors:\nhist(error)\n\nLooks like a normal distribution hey? That’s because we generated them from a normal distribution. That was a handy trick, because the basic linear model assumes the errors are normally distributed (but not necessarily the raw data).\nAlso note that sigma is constant (e.g. it doesn’t get larger as x gets larger). That is another assumption of basic linear models called ‘homogeneity of variance’.\n\n\n\nTo fit a basic linear model in R we can use the lm() function:\nm1 &lt;- lm(y_obs ~ x)\nIt takes a formula argument, which simply says here that y_obs depends on (the tilde ~) x. R will do all the number crunching to estimate the parameters now.\nTo see what it came up with try:\ncoef(m1)\n\n## (Intercept)           x\n##   30.163713    2.028646\nThis command tells us the estimate of the intercept ((Intercept)) and the slope on x under x. Notice they are close to, but not exactly the same as alpha and beta. So the model has done a pretty decent job of recovering our original process. The reason the values are not identical is that we simulated someone going and measuring the real process with error (that was when we added the normal random numbers).\nWe can get slightly more details about the model fit like this:\nsummary(m1)\n\n##\n## Call:\n## lm(formula = y_obs ~ x)\n##\n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max\n## -7.2467 -1.5884  0.1942  1.5665  5.3433\n##\n## Coefficients:\n##             Estimate Std.

With the summary, we get standard errors for the parameter estimates (which is a measure of how much they might vary). Also notice the R-squared, which can be handy. Finally, notice that the Residual standard error is close to the value we used for sigma, which is because it is an estimate of sigma from our simulated data.\nYour homework is play around with the model and sampling process. Try change alpha, beta, n and sigma, then refit the model and see what happens.\n\n\n\nSo did you do the homework? If you did, well done, you just performed a simple power analysis (in the broad sense).\nIn a more formal power analysis (which is what you might have come across previously) could systematically vary n or beta and for 1000 randomised data sets and then calculate the proportion out of 1000 data-sets that your p-value was ‘significant’ (e.g. less than a critical threshold like the ever-popular 0.05). This number tells you how good you are at detecting ‘real’ effects.\nHere’s a great intro to power analysis in the broad sense: Bolker, Ecological Models and Data in R\nOne more point. Remember we said above about some ‘assumptions’. Well we can check those in R quite easily:\nplot(m1, 1)\n\nThis shows a plot of the residuals (A.K.A. errors) versus the predicted values. We are looking for ‘heteroskedasticity’ which is a fancy way of saying the errors aren’t equal across the range of predictions (remember I said sigma is a constant?).\nAnother good plot:\nplot(m1, 2)\n\nHere we are looking for deviations of the points from the line. Points on the line mean the errors are approximately normally distributed, which was a key assumption. Points far from the line could indicate the errors are skewed left or right, too fat in the middle, or too in the middle skinny. More on that issue here\n\n\n\nSo the basics might belie the true complexity of situations we can address with General Linear Models and their relatives Generalized Linear Models. But, just to get you excited, here are a few things you can do by adding on more terms to the right hand side of the linear equation:\n\nModel multiple, interacting covariates.\nInclude factors as covariates (instead of continuous variables). Got a factor and a continuous variable? Don’t bother with the old-school ANCOVA method, just use a linear model.\nInclude a spline to model non-linear effects (that’s a GAM).\nAccount for hierarchies in your sampling, like transects sampled within sites (that’s a mixed effects model)\nAccount for spatial or temporal dependencies.\nModel varying error variance (e.g. when the variance increases with the mean).\n\nYou can also change the left-hand side, so that it no longer assumes normality (then that’s a Generalized Linear Model). Or even add chains of models together to model pathways of cause and effect (that’s a ‘path analysis’ or ‘structural equation model’)\nIf this taster has left you keen to learn more, then check out any one of the zillion online courses or books on GLMs with R, or if you can get to Brisbane, come to our next course (which as of writing was in Feb 2018, but we do them regularly).\nNow you know the basics, practice, practice, practice and pretty soon you will be running General Linear Models behind your back while you watch your 2 year old, which is what I do for kicks."

I used normal characters for variables (i.e. things you measure) and Greek letters for parameters, which are estimated when you fit the model to the data.\nyi are your response data, I indexed the y with i to indicate that there are multiple observations. xi is variously known as a covariate, predictor variable or explanatory variable. α is an intercept that will be estimated. α has the same units as y. (e.g. if y is number of animals, then α is expected the number of animals when x = 0).\nβ is a slope parameter that will also be estimated. β is also termed the effect size because it measures the effect of x on y. β has units of ‘y per x’. For instance, if x is temperature, then β has units of number of animals per degree C. β thus measures how much we expect y to change if x were to increase by 1.\nFinally, don’t forget ϵi, which is the error. ϵi will measure the distance between each prediction of yi made by the model and the observed value of yi.\nThese predictions will simply be calculated as:\nyi = α + βxi*\n(notice I just removed the ϵi from the end).

    "section": "Foundational Principles",
    "text": "Foundational Principles\n1. Consider your audience\nIf you’re targeting an international journal, your readers will be international scientists. They will be less interested in hearing about the specific organisms in your part of the ocean and more interested in understanding what your results mean for their own research contexts. Frame your findings in terms of broader ecological patterns, processes, or principles that transcend geographic boundaries.\n2. Establish global context through strategic citations\nCite global studies and literature from multiple regions, not just your local area. Global studies are often well-cited because they provide the comparative framework that regional studies need. When citing studies from other regions, be strategic about which ones you include:\n\nChoose contrasting systems: Select studies from regions with different environmental conditions (temperate vs. tropical, shallow vs. deep, pristine vs. degraded) to highlight what makes your system unique or generalizable.\nInclude similar systems for comparison: Find studies from ecologically similar regions to show whether your findings represent broader patterns or regional anomalies.\nReference methodological precedents: Cite studies that used similar approaches in other regions, even if the ecological focus differs, to establish the credibility of your methods.\nDraw from different disciplines: Include studies from related fields (e.g., terrestrial ecology, freshwater systems) when they provide relevant theoretical context or methodological insights.\n\nPosition your region within this broader context by explicitly comparing and contrasting your findings with patterns observed elsewhere. For example: “While coral bleaching in the Caribbean typically occurs at 29°C, our Pacific sites showed bleaching at 31°C, suggesting regional adaptation to higher baseline temperatures.” This demonstrates that you understand the global state of knowledge and can articulate where your work fits."

    "section": "Specific Framing Strategies",
    "text": "Specific Framing Strategies\n3. Connect to established theories and frameworks\nRelate your case-study to general ecological theories or established analytical frameworks. For example, your work could be an application of the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response) framework to your region, or a test of the recruitment limitation hypothesis in a new system. This approach transforms your regional study from a descriptive account into a contribution to broader scientific understanding.\n4. Demonstrate novelty without claiming “firsts”\nState your contributions by explaining why your approach or findings matter, rather than simply claiming precedence. Avoid phrases like “this is the first time.” Instead, draw parallels to successful applications in other fields or regions. For example, rather than “This is the first time we’ve used machine learning for fisheries,” try “Machine learning has proven highly effective for predictions in agriculture and could provide similar benefits for fisheries management.”\n5. Highlight unique perspectives and unexpected findings\nShow how your case-study reveals new patterns or challenges existing assumptions compared to other regional studies. Focus on findings that offer fresh insights into well-studied processes. For example: “While marine heatwaves are known to cause widespread mortality, our study reveals that toxic plankton blooms can flourish during these events, creating compound ecological impacts.”\n6. Present methodological innovations\nFrame your work as developing or refining methodological approaches, with your regional study serving as a proof-of-concept. This strategy is particularly powerful when you’ve adapted techniques from other disciplines or combined existing methods in novel ways. Emphasize how the method could be applied in other regions or systems, making your local study a stepping stone to broader applications."

Demonstrate real-world applications\nWhen conducting applied research, explicitly show how your science has been used for conservation or management decisions. One excellent example is Rick Hamilton’s turtle tracking paper. While countless studies track turtles, Hamilton got his work published in an international conservation journal by demonstrating how the tracking data directly informed conservation actions. He also capitalized on a review highlighting that most tracking studies fail to influence conservation practice, establishing his work’s unique value.\n8. Connect to global goals and initiatives\nLink your research to internationally recognized objectives and frameworks. This connection is increasingly common and effective. For example: “SDG 14.4 aims to make fisheries sustainable by 2020. Achieving this goal requires better models of climate impacts on fish populations—precisely what our study provides.” Other relevant frameworks include the Convention on Biological Diversity targets, national biodiversity strategies, and organizational goals like those of the Global Mangrove Alliance. These connections help editors and reviewers understand your work’s broader significance."

Once you’ve put down the obvious ones, think a bit more creatively and put some ‘outside the box’ options down too.\nFor instance, you may be considering taking further courses in statistics versus starting a PhD. But maybe a third option is to seek work as technical support on a research team, and learn the technical skills on the job.\nOr maybe the option is between pursuing a PhD locally, or going overseas.\nYou should then check that the options are viable. For instance, contact the graduate office of possible universities and see what qualifications are needed to get into a PhD program. In North America you generally need masters, whereas in Australia you need a qualification equivalent to First Class Honours.\nThere are other logistical things you should consider too, like financial viability of more study for your personally.\nFor me at the end of my Honours degree the options where: apply to an Australian PhD program, apply to an international PhD program, find a job as a government scientist. After some email and research I very quickly figured out an international PhD was very unlikely, because I didn’t have a masters. So I focused my efforts on a local PhD or a job."

Also, I’ll have the independence to pursue my own research interests.\nQuestion: How will pursing my own research interests be good for me?\nAnswer: I enjoy being creative and having the independence to be creative in my own way.\nSo basically, a decision that for me on the face of it was just about doing interesting things and pursuing the career I’d always wanted, turned out to be about the freedom to be creative (among other things of course, I’m sure your goals will be more complex than this).\nYou might like to repeat the above questions for the other options you listed under ‘What’."

    "text": "Who has influenced this decision?\nNow you have a better idea of what you want to achieve and why, think about the people and experiences that have influenced these values.\nNow I’m mid-career, its surprising how many people I meet who are dissatisfied in their career as a scientist, accountant, lawyer, or whatever career. They are in the career because at an early stage, someone advised them to follow that career (like their parents or an important early mentor), and they invested so much in it that they never changed.\nSo think about who is influencing you.\nIt might also be experiences that influence you. For me, seeing the environment change (for the worse) was a big influence, but so too were a lot of people and mentors.\nWhat you are trying to do is find your own goals and not follow a career for other people’s goals.\nAnother important part of the ‘who’ question is to seek advise and multiple different perspectives on your decision. So if you can talk to people from a range of career stages and ask them about their career.\nTalk to current PhD students, to get a better idea of the joys and challenges of doing a PhD (it’s not easy, you need to be motivated!). Talk to successful career scientists. Talk to people who have longer careers, in any career, and find out how they made their career choices. You want to get lots of different perspectives on this decision.\nIf you are happy you truly have your own goals then proceed below. If not, then perhaps you want to revisit the what, where, how steps above."

    "text": "When do I need to make these decisions?\nThe what, where how, who may take you a few hours, or it may take months. For me it took months, including applying to numerous PhD programs locally and overseas. I applied for jobs too and even got offered one in a government research organisation. In the end however, I realised I wanted creative freedom, so I took a PhD scholarship offer.\nOnce you feel like you have a grip on your values, then its time to figure out how to get there. So look at your 3-5 year goal. Now work backwards from that to now, to figure out what steps you need to take to get you there. Maybe you need to do more study, so you can get into a PhD program, or maybe you don’t.\nFor me it was pretty simple:\n5 year goal was to have a research job (government or uni) where I could have an impact on environmental issues, but also be senior enough that I’d have the freedom to pursue my own ideas. So to get that job I needed a PhD. I had the qualifications already to apply for a PhD scholarship in Australia, and options for PhD scholarships in my specific field, so that was the decision I ended up making.\nA note of thanks to Mark Douglas and Ethos Australia for inspiring this post at recent workshop I took on research leadership."

Given I was giving a talk about R datavisuals I thought it would be fun to visualise the quiz results using R live with the audience. To top it off, we posted the results to Twitter.\nThis blog describes is how I did that.\n{% include r-courses-ad.html %}\nYou could also use this system to survey our audience and share the results live. Just prepare you R code and set it to run at a certain time during your talk with a task scheduling algorithm.\n\n\nI used Google Forms to do my quiz. You can take it here. I posed a few questions that challenged the audience to think about the best way to visualise data.\nIt is pretty easy to set up a survey if you have a gmail account. A few tips:\n\nYou can add images, which is great posing questions about results.\nI used the ‘short answer’ input for numeric answers. If you click the validation tab at the bottom of each ‘short answer’ question you can require users enter certain types of numbers (e.g. within a range).\nThink carefully about limiting required inputs if you want to avoid bugs that might arise from unexpected answers.\nThere is a green button at the top of the form that let’s you link it to a google sheet. Do this.\nYou can make the sheet public, so other people can use it, but changing the sharing settings.\n\n\n\n\nI used the googlesheets package to read my survey answers from the (public) spreadsheet. You will need to authenticate yourself first:\nlibrary(googlesheets)\ngs_ls()\nThis will prompt you to login to your google account and authenticate an app that allows the connection to happen.\nNow we can load our data:\nsheet_url &lt;- \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10i3v3NIVpgmURyLVzsiadPAMGeqa7dLFcDb9sqFe8KA/edit#gid=1513779153\"\ndataviz &lt;- gs_url(sheet_url) #creates connection\nIf you want to keep your sheet private you can use gs_ls() to list all your sheets, and then pick a name to read it in. e.g. like this:\ndataviz &lt;- gs_title(\"Dataviz quiz 2018 v2 (Responses)\")\ndat &lt;- gs_read(dataviz)\n\n\n\nThe file dat we just read in is a dataframe like object (actually a tibble) where each column is a question and each row is a response. The first column is a time stamp.\nAll other columns are titled with your questions.\nIt will make life easier if we rename the columns to shorter (but still descriptive) names.\nnewnames &lt;- c(\"timestamp\", \"shopping\",\n              \"bar_percent\",\n              \"pie_percent\",\n              \"room\",\n              \"cb_age\")\nnames(dat) &lt;- newnames\nNow let’s create some dataviz\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndatplot &lt;- na.omit(dat)\nggplot(datplot, aes(x = room, y = cb_age)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  xlab(\"Position in room\") +\n  ylab(\"Guess at CB's age\") +\n  ylim(0, 75) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nA boxplot of the audience’s guesses at my age by their position in the room. I limited the y-axis because there were some outrageously large numbers!\n\n\n\nWe could show the audience the results on our screen. But why not let Twitter know too!\nFor this, I used the rtweet package. rtweet is pretty simple to use once you’ve set up an app on Twitter’s API and authorised R to access it. So get rtweet then look at the vignette vignette(\"auth\"). Follow the instructions to the letter and you shouldn’t have any problems.\nOnce authorisation is done, its a simple matter to save our plot as a png to use in a tweet:\nmyplot &lt;- ggplot(datplot, aes(x = room, y = cb_age)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\nggsave(filename = \"myplot.png\", myplot)\nNow just write your tweet and send it off to twitter.\nlibrary(rtweet)\nnewstatus = \"Chris age as surveyed at  #UQwinterSchool\n@DoktrNick @UQwinterSchool\"\n\npost_tweet(status = newstatus,\n           media = \"myplot.png\")\n\n\n\nSo I tried this as a way of doing a live R tutorial. Next step would be to try and integrate it into a talk without showing the R coding. For that you would either need to get a friend to run the code or use a scheduler (like the taskscheduleR R package).\nBe careful though! You never know what answers people may give if allowed. So design you code to be robust to strange answers (like that I am 100 years old)."

    "text": "I was reading an example of visualising election outcome uncertainty using a wobbly needle and wondered, could animating uncertainty help communicate for the kind of work I do on population modelling?\n\nOne challenge when plotting uncertainty intervals for population trends is that confidence intervals don’t capture the wandering nature of population processes. The figure here shows the median of a poisson random walk, with 90% quantiles.\nIn fact, each trend line will wander around, like the next image. So, the median and intervals give a false impression that an individual trend will experience relative stability.\n\n \n\nA graph of the median and quantiles doesn’t represent the uncertainty in any single trend line very well.\n\n\nI decided to try and animate the uncertainty, using R.\nThe first step was to try and install the R package animate. Unfortunately I was in a world of Unix coding pain trying to get animation to work. In particular to get R to talk to the ImageMagick program. After cutting and pasting numerous commands from StackOverflow to my terminal I gave up. It seems I need to update my OS before I can get any further (from Mavericks).\nIn the end I found I could use ImageMagick directly from the command line. So now what we need is a folder full of .png files that we wish to turn into the animation. That Unix code to do that is at the end of this blog.\nFirst we should set up a random walk process. I decided to go for a Poisson random walk, because it will have integer numbers, like a real population. I wrote a little function to achieve this:\nwalkmod &lt;- function(t, yinit, thetasd, rho){\n  y &lt;- numeric(t)\n  y[1] &lt;- yinit\n  theta &lt;- rnorm(t, sd = thetasd)\n  for(i in 2:t){\n    lambda &lt;- (y[i-1]*rho + yinit*(1-rho))* exp(theta[i])\n    y[i] &lt;- rpois(1, lambda)\n  }\n  return(y)\n}\nThe core equation is in the for loop. It just says the mean abundance at a given time is dependent on abundance at the last time-step with correlation rho plus some extra variation theta. We then sample the observed abundance from a poisson distribution.\nNow let’s use our function. We will load in the purrr package to help plotting replicate runs of the random walk and the leaflet package because it has some nice functions for making colour scales.\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nt &lt;- 50\nyinit &lt;- 10\nthetasd &lt;- 0.01\nrho &lt;- 0.9\nn &lt;- 30\ny &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = t, ncol = n)\ntmat &lt;- matrix(rep(1:t), nrow = t, ncol = n)\nfor (i in 1:n){\n    set.seed(i)\n    y[,i] &lt;- walkmod(t, yinit, thetasd, rho)\n}\nymax &lt;- max(y)\nmedy &lt;- apply(y, 1 , median)\nWe just looped over the walkmod function n times so we could generate n random walks.\nNow let’s build a colour scale. I would like to colour the lines by the abundance quantile they end on. So we apply colorQuantile to all abundances in the last time-step to get a red to blue (RdBu) colour palette for the lines:\nquants &lt;- c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)\nyquant &lt;- quantile(y[t,], probs = quants)\nmycols &lt;- colorQuantile(\"RdBu\", domain = y[t,], probs = quants)\nThe trick to making a .gif animation is just to make a bunch of figures and save them as .png files in the order you want them to animate (or if you can get animate package to work within R you can export the .gif directly without having to save the .pngs).\nSo we just loop over walkmod plotting our lines each time. Note I use walk from the purrr package to redraw the background lines in grey each time.\nthispath &lt;- \"/insert/your/path/here/\"\nfor (i in 1:n){\n    fname &lt;- paste(thispath, i, \".png\", sep = \"\")\n    png(filename =fname, width = 480, height = 480)\n    plot(0, 0, xlim = c(0, t), ylim = c(0, ymax),\n         bty = 'n', type = \"n\", las = 1,\n         ylab = \"Abundance\", xlab = \"Time\")\n    lines(1:t, medy, col = \"grey90\", lwd = 2)\n    walk(1:i, ~lines(tmat[,.x], y[,.x], lwd = 0.7, col = grey(0.5, 0.2)))\n  lines(1:t, y[,i], lwd = 2, col = mycols(y[t, i]))\n    legend(\"topleft\", legend = quants,\n        lwd = 2, col = mycols(yquant),\n    title = \"Quantile t=100\", cex = 0.8)\n  dev.off()\n}\nIf you want to check this from R, without saving the files, then turn of the png() function that saves the files and insert Sys.sleep(0.1) at the end of the loop, so it will print each figure in turn but pause for 1/10 th of second each time.\nWe have one final figure to plot, that is the median line. We can do this outside the for loop:\nfname &lt;- paste(thispath, i+1, \".png\",  sep = \"\")\npng(filename =fname, width = 480, height = 480)\nplot(0, 0, xlim = c(0, t), ylim = c(0, ymax),\n     bty = 'n', type = \"n\", las = 1,\n     ylab = \"Abundance\", xlab = \"Time\", main = \"Median\")\nwalk(1:i, ~lines(tmat[,.x], y[,.x], lwd = 0.5, col = grey(0.5, 0.2)))\nlines(1:t, medy, lwd = 3, col = \"purple\")\ndev.off()\nFinally, here is the unix code to run imageMagick from your terminal to turn your saved .png files into a gif.\ncd \"your/path/here\"\nmagick *.png images.gif\nconvert images.gif -set delay 30 \\( +clone -set delay 100 \\) +swap +delete images_pause.gif\nThe first line creates the gif and the second line adds a pause of 30 1/100ths of a second after each image and a pause of 1 second at the end of the loop."

    "text": "Just want to quickly highlight a few investigative blogs on the environmental impacts of LLMs.\nThere are two main issues: water use (for cooling servers) and carbon emissions generated by creating the hardware, training the models and then using the models to get responses (‘inference’).\nThis blog does a deep dive on the water issues. The key finding is that the water issues seem to be overstated (he says ‘fake’ but I don’t agree with that word choice, water issues are real, just overstated).\nThen academic Hannah Ritchies and author of ‘Sustainability by Numbers’ page sums up the carbon cost of chatGPT. She draws heavily on Andy Masley detailed work.\nIn particular, blog author (Andy Masley) argues that the public has limited attention span for environmental issues and AI isn’t the biggest priority. He sums it up nicely:\n“AI water use is mostly fake, personal prompt costs are mostly fake, but AI as a whole is going to put a huge strain on our electrical grid going forward that’s going to matter a lot for the green energy transition, local electricity prices, and air pollution”\nBy fake, he means your personal usage is trivially small. He highlights golf courses and streaming videos as much larger uses of water and emissions respectively.\nWhat also matters is the counterfactual - ie what would you be doing if you weren’t using chatGPT? If you would be online shopping, using a microwave or streaming videos instead, then your personal emissions are probably slightly lower if you switch your time to chatGPT.\nIf you are concerned about the impacts of your AI use you can easily do a personal offset by commiting to some simple behaviour changes. e.g. turn you computer off at night and turn it off at the power plug."

The oceans are increasingly being industrialized, and climate change means the footprint of human economic activity now touches even the most remote ecosystems.\nCoastal ecosystems exemplify the challenges we face in managing our growing impacts. Coasts are the thin line on which much of the human population and industrial activity rests. This human activity places great pressures on coastal ecosystems, and in many places we are losing species and the ecological functions that support human livelihoods, like fisheries.\nPredicting the future for coastal ecosystems is critical for creating a sustainable relationship between humanity and nature.

    "title": "Tips for using chatGPT to learn R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "ChatGPT can help you learn R code. Here are some tips my team and I have worked out for ways to use the model to help with learning R.\nThere is also an askgpt package now that is meant to integrate ChatGPT directly into RStudio. However, I’ve been unable to get this package to work on my laptop.\n\nAsk GPT to explain R code\nIf you can find code on the web, from collaborators or a supervisor you don’t understand, then trying asking GPT to explain it to you. Here’s an example:\nPrompt: explain this R code: m1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(year, by = sites), data = my_data, family = “poisson”)\nGPT: The code m1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(year, by = sites), data = my_data) specifies a generalized additive model (GAM) in R.\nHere’s what each part of the code means:\nm1 &lt;- : assigns the output of the model to the object named m1. gam() : specifies that we want to fit a generalized additive model. y ~ s(year, by = sites) : specifies the model formula, where y is the response variable and year is the predictor variable of interest. The function s() specifies that year is a smooth function, which allows for a flexible fit to the data. The by = sites argument specifies that we want to fit separate smooth functions for each sites level, which is a way to model site-specific effects.*\nOverall, this code fits a GAM to the data in my_data, with year as a smooth predictor variable and site-specific effects modeled with by = sites.\nIt gets everything right.\nThis tool is helping me keep meetings with my research students at a high level. We talk about what are appropriate methods and statistical designs, and don’t need to spend as much time discussing how to code those.\n\n\nAsk GPT advice on appropriate statistical models\nYou use GPT to get started on a new problem. Say you had count data but weren’t sure how to analyse it or even the name of the correct method. You could ask something this:\nPrompt: How would I do a regression model with count data in R\nGPT: There are several ways to model count data in R, but one popular method is to use Poisson regression or Negative Binomial regression. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to fit a Poisson regression model in R:…\nAnd GPT continues to explain how to write a poisson GLM in R (one appropriate way to do regression with count data).\nYou can often improve GPT’s answers by breaking your questions into smaller chunks. So first ask it for advice on regression of count data. Then ask for an example in R.\n\n\nGenerate simulated datasets\nTo gain a more general understanding of a method it might help you to work with some simulated (made-up data). GPT can help you write code to do this as well. Following on from the example above I asked it to generate simulated data.\nPrompt: How would I simulate some data to test the poisson glm?\nGPT: To simulate count data for testing a Poisson GLM, you can use the rpois() function in R, which generates random numbers from a Poisson distribution with a given mean. Here is an example of how to simulate count data with two predictor variables:\nset.seed(123) # for reproducibility\n\nn &lt;- 100 # number of observations\nx1 &lt;- rnorm(n) # predictor variable 1\nx2 &lt;- rnorm(n) # predictor variable 2\nlambda &lt;- exp(0.5 + 0.8*x1 - 0.2*x2) # log-linear model with intercept 0.5 and coefficients 0.8 and -0.2\n\ny &lt;- rpois(n, lambda) \n… And then GPT continues to explain what the above code does.\n\n\nCreate customised examples\nIt helps to learn R and statistics if the examples you are learning from are for a familar context. This one one reason why there are so many R books and tutorials that overlap in the methods they explain, just in different contexts, like “R for Ecologists”, “R for Medical Research”, ’R for Microbiology” etc…\nYou can get GPT to write you customised tutorial. That way you get the explanation in a context you know. It can be easier to learn a tangible application in a context you know, before you try to learn how to use a method more generally.\nFollowing the poisson regression example above, we could ask GPT to modify its explanation for a specific context:\nPrompt: Rewrite the R code for simulating data using an example of what predicts the number of easter eggs the easter bunny brings\nGPT: Sure, here’s an example of how to simulate count data based on a linear model that predicts the number of Easter eggs brought by the Easter bunny:…\nThen GPT continued with basically the same code as above, where it gave x1 and x2 as the predictors. It also provided a warning at the end:\nNote that this is just an example, and in reality, the number of Easter eggs brought by the Easter bunny is likely to depend on more complex factors that may not be accurately captured by a simple linear model. Additionally, the true distribution of the count data may be more complex than a Poisson distribution, and may require a more advanced simulation approach to accurately capture its properties\nI further prompted it again to explain what x1 and x2 could be\nPrompt: What would be predictors of the number of easter eggs?\nThere are many potential predictors that could influence the number of Easter eggs brought by the Easter bunny. Here are a few possibilities: Number of children in a household: It stands to reason that the number of Easter eggs brought by the Easter bunny would be higher in households with more children, since the bunny would have more individuals to provide for. Household income: Depending on the cultural context, the number of Easter eggs brought by the Easter bunny could be influenced by the socioeconomic status of the household. For example, in some cultures, more affluent households may be more likely to provide larger quantities of Easter eggs….*\nAnd it continued with other plausible suggestions.\n\n\nMaking stats more fun\nYou can go further with the bunnies above, using any example you like to keep yourself entertained (topics that are well known on the web will work best). For instance, I prompted GPT to write an explanation of generalized additive models in the style of an 18th century author. It used the classic ‘cars’ dataset. So I additionally prompted it to use horses as an example instead..\nAny style that is well known on the internet should work. You can ask for a crime novel with a gripping plot twist, in the style of a particular author like J.K. Rowling or as a script from Netflix series Bridgerton. If you are really passionate about R you could even try asking GPT for an explanation in the style of 50 Shades of Grey…\n\n\nPitfalls and words of warning\nChatGPT is just another tool we can use for learning. It can be part of your toolbox, but should not be the sole tool you use, it has pitfalls. It can give wrong or biased answers. Generally its correct, but some responses I’ve prompted have errors in the R code or in statistical logic. So always check your code independently. This should include running tests or working with someone who knows the correct way.\nChatGPT can also generate code with bugs, which could be hard for beginners to debug (especially if they are the types of bugs that don’t throw errors).\nMake sure you ask it clearly framed questions. Additionally, it has a ‘token’ limit (tokens are parts of words), so give it lots of smaller requests rather than one huge one.\nGPT may learn from text you enter, so don’t put in personal information or your best research ideas.\nFinally, I’m now seeing R blog posts that I’m sure are written by ChatGPT or similar models (you can tell by the style). I don’t have a problem with this, so long as the code is checked and corrected. So when searching for tutorials online make sure they are from reputable authors who you can trust to have verified their code and corrected any mistakes in explanation."

Here I’ll discuss some of the strategies I when planning the application.\n\nI start writing the proposal early. Starting writing months ahead gets me thinking seriously about the ideas and gives me plenty of thinking time (not reported above). I always have a notebook on hand, once I start I never know when an idea will pop into my head.\nWriting, writing, writing. This helps get the ideas flowing and irons out the logical inconsistencies. I only use half of less of what I write, but I need to write to sift out and refine the good quality ideas (I understand that’s not the same for everyone).\nI start early on both the project design and the ‘investigator’ sections. I find I need as much time to think about the ‘investigator’ sections as the project design section. Good ideas for how to clearly communicate your career track record and past work are invaluable (though I find the part where I’m writing about myself the most painful part of grant writing).\nRecruiting collaborators. Starting early also gives me time to recruit co-investigators on the grant, and get their input.\nRecruit experienced reviewers. You need to start early to give them time to have input\nUnderstand the rules and jargon. Grant assessment criteria are full of jargon and words with very specific meanings. e.g. ‘Benefit’ and ‘Significance’ mean two different things to the ARC, if you mix them up you will probably score badly. Experienced grant writers can help point you in the write direction.\nI don’t spend much time on the budget until the final month. I have a rough idea of the limit and what I need to do what’s in the grant, but its one of the last things I refine, since the details are very dependent on what ends up in the project design.\n\nFinally, if its your first time writing a grant prepare to be overwhelmed by the number of different sections. In an ARC there’s project design, institutional support statement, budget, budget justification, industry partner support letters (for some grants), investigator career opportunities, investigator career impact, investigator citation metrics, … it goes on and on.\nStarting early will give you time to focus on getting your head around what needs to go into each individual section."

This will help you keep the data organised.\nNote if using github: make sure your include /data in your gitignore, so that the folder doesn’t sync to github. WIthin the data folder put everything that doesn’t go on github including .rda files, images and documents (exception being .md or .Rmd files). The reason for this is that version control on these types of files consumes a lot of memory (git will save a new file copy each time you make a change, rather than just saving the change)."

You can quickly load the data and make the changes, without having to re-run analyses.\nLikewise if figures are made from the results of an analysis, save the final results before they are plotted and have a script just for the plotting.\nI usually have code for plots at the end of my analysis script, which are there for checking.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Rising seas and coastal development are pushing mangrove forests beyond their historical limits. Predicting how these critical ecosystems will respond is much harder when environmental change is unprecedented. In a new study, Projecting Uncertainty in Ecosystem Persistence Under Climate Change, we show how to estimate the probability that mangrove forests will persist or decline worldwide.\nGood predictions of ecosystem persistence are essential for coastal protection, fisheries management and climate-smart conservation planning.\nThe problem is that traditional models require detailed data that doesn’t exist at global scales. Models predict best when conditions match their training data. Climate change means mangroves face conditions they’ve never experienced before.\nWe developed a method to estimate probabilities of mangrove persistence using global datasets. This gives us a way to measure uncertainty that we can use to guide conservation decisions, e.g. to identify where management actions are most likely to succeed.\nWe used network models to analyze how mangroves respond at both their seaward and landward edges. Mangroves are unique because they can potentially expand in both directions as seas rise - landward into newly flooded areas, or seaward by trapping sediment.\nHere’s the projections for persistence of mangroves as they are currently (ie without any loss) from one of our scenarios:\n\nOur models reveal a stark contrast. 77% of mangrove units worldwide are likely to lose area at their seaward edge by 2040-2060. Rising seas, storms and reduced sediment from dammed rivers create multiple pressures. In contrast, about 30% of units could gain area landward, but coastal development often blocks this migration.\nPerhaps most importantly, uncertainty is high. In more than half the mangrove units studied, we couldn’t predict whether forests would persist or decline - the probability was essentially random. This isn’t a model failure. It tells us where better data and management actions could tip the balance.\nGeographic patterns emerged clearly. Mangroves in areas with small tidal ranges face greater risks. Sediment-rich coastlines offer better prospects for seaward expansion. Areas with dense coastal populations face the greatest landward migration challenges.\nWe tested conservation scenarios and found encouraging results. With targeted management - sediment addition, barrier removal, and assisted migration - the number of units likely to persist could nearly double.\nThis research shows a new way to handle ecosystem predictions under climate change. Instead of false precision, we quantify what we know and don’t know. For mangroves, significant seaward losses are likely, but landward gains and conservation success remain possible with strategic action. Read more here."

    "text": "Tips to prepare for the transition\n\nMetacognition\nMetacognition is self-awareness of your thought processes. For research its particularly key to be self-aware of how you learn.\nUnderstanding how to learn means you can quickly and more smoothly immerse yourself in a new research topic.\nFor PhD supervisors you can point out or ask questions to help students understand their own thought and learning processes. For example, one metacognition trick is to use analogy to solve a new problem.\nAnother skill is understanding how you learn (is it by reading, by talking to people, by doing? ). This can help you come to grips with a new topic if you know how to research it and what is the best way that works for you.\nExposing yourself to a broad range of different types of research (for me this meant attending the biology department seminar which ranged from fisheries topics I was interested in to neuroscience which could still be interesting though not directly relevant to my studies then).\n\n\nPresentation and communication skills\nThese skills are just broadly useful in many careers and easy to translate.\nIts one reason we practice facilitation of meetings in our lab meetings.\nThings to think about in your PhD (or for supervisors) are to get a broad view on different ways of presenting information. Sometimes our PhDs are too focused on academic publications and presentations.\nRead, and look for opportunities to write in other formats such as blogs, media releases, reports and policy briefs.\nFor presentations, take comms training (if its available), do media interviews if you get the chance. Participating in 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) is another great way to learn presentation skills that are highly transferable.\n\n\nLearning who matters and who you report to\nLots of people will give you advice or directions. Some of it is good, some not so good. Understanding of reporting structures in your organisation is important so you can understand your role and what the organisation wants you to achieve.\nIn your postdoc you may have less autonomy in some ways than you had in your PhD. Often postdocs are funded to deliver a certain project outcome (e.g. for industry partner or government).\nThis will mean you need to better differentiate between helpful advisors and project leaders that you need to deliver too.\nAs you progress in your career its also important to learn more about institutional structures. For instance, your supervisor might report to a head of school who reports to a dean who reports to a pro-vice chancellor. You probably didn’t pay too much attention to this stuff in your PhD.\nIt becomes increasingly important to understand as you move up in your career."

Your new colleagues are usually happy to help.\nIt could be small things like how to navigate the financial reimbursement system. This can save you a lot of time.\nMost universities and large institutions will also provide access to counselling and mental health care services, so take make the most of those if you are finding the new job or move stressful.\n\n\nLearning a new topic\nDon’t underestimate the time it takes to learn a new topic. So give yourself (and talk to your supervisor about having) time to learn the new topic.\nAnd the final tip from the team was to read old papers, from 10, 20, 30 years ago or more. When you are approaching a new topic these papers give you essential background and are often simpler to understand. Its also helpful to understand the historical context of a new research field."

    "text": "Here’s my timeline of going from frequentist stats to becoming a fully fledged Bayesian eco-statistician.\n2006 Read the Ecological Detective (Hilborn and Walters), the philosophy makes sense, the history of falsification is interesting but, geez, the maths looks hard.\n2008 Started PhD. Peers also interested in Bayes stats. But, Prof gets angry and tells us “ANOVA is all you will ever need”. We rebel and start a study group on that James Clark book with elephants on the front cover.\nGeez, the maths is even harder than I remember.\nNot comfortable with the ‘subjective’ aspect of Bayesian stats (AKA prior information). But its ok to use Bayesian stats for its flexibility, so long as we use ‘uninformed’ priors.\n2009 Read that Mick McCarthy book with the frog on the front cover. Start playing around in WinBUGS. BUGS code breaks the mystery of mixed effects models in R. MM models are just a series of equations, and much more than the obscure magic of R model formulas.\n2014 Actually published a paper on something with statistics in it (first time ever). (Interdependency of tropical marine ecosystems in response to climate change). Used frequentist GLM. Leant heavily on advice in that Zuur, Ieno et al. book that has penguins on the front cover.\n2017 Publish first Bayesian eco-stats paper. Went all out with a bespoke non-linear latent variable GLM in JAGS. Use broad ‘uninformed priors’, because the data should speak for themselves.\nBrian Fry convinces me there is a big problem with the ‘uninformed priors’ used in isotope mixing models. Studies with poor data seem to unwittingly present the priors as their result.\nWinter 2017 Obsessed with the apparent simplicity and speed of the INLA rstats package for Bayesian GLMMs. Frequently taking hot baths in evening to read the latest INLA pre-print. Wife thinks I’m odd.\n(Later on realize INLA is very fast, but not so simple)\nAutumn 2018 Started paper about sharks with regular frequentist GAMs. Finished paper with Bayesian GAMMs, because lead author wants random effects in a time-series model AND “confidence intervals” plotted on the graph. Too hard with GAMs, easy with Bayes.\nPublish paper on how Bayesian isotope mixing models can’t have uninformed priors. It is just mathematically impossible. Now convinced we should always use prior information to develop Bayesian priors.\nObsession with reading INLA in the bath vindicated by publishing in Nature.\nRead about ‘penalized complexity priors’. Now convinced priors for random effects should be ‘informed’ (or regularizing), even if we don’t have prior information.\n2018/2019 Read that red and black MacElreath’s book about rethinking. Agree that using informed priors for fixed effects is actually more conservative than broad priors.\nIn fact, realize now that no prior is truly ‘uninformed’, some are just broader than others. Broad priors can’t be ‘uninformed’, because they are just are informed about a high variance.\n2019 Used INLA and Bayesian stats to do a simple linear regression. Never going back to frequentist.\nConvinced postdoc to use informed priors for his model. Model works much better, results make much more sense.\n2020 Insist PhD students have to use Bayesian stats over frequentist stats too?"

    "text": "What defines a (successful) scientist? Their collaborations, their Phd supervisor, their students, who they cite, conferences they attend and citations of their publications all indicate what field they belong to and how successfull they are as a researcher.\nIn short, scientists are defined by their network of influence.\nThis is a brief blog on using social media to enhance your research network. It has been prepared as a supplement for my talk at the Australian Rivers Institute (13/6/2017), but should also stand alone.\n\n\nA great way to learn how to blog is to start copying the style of other people who are good at it.\nA good way to find out who is good at blogging (or social media in general) is to look at the Altmetrics for your favourite papers.\nAltmetrics will give you a influence score for a paper that includes among other things the number of blogs it could detect. You can get a handy link for your browser to quickly view Altmetrics here.\nIf you have your own blog, make sure you get it registered with Altmetrics. Also make sure you include a link or DOI for your paper in the blog.\nThere are many ways to write a blog, but to start I recommend writing about one of your research articles. You want to hit the points below, making sure that the significance of the work, the problem you addressed and the solutions are given priority. Methods and detailed lit review are less important (or don’t even include them!):\nA reasonable blog structure:\n\nThe significance of the work to a generalist audience.\nWhat you did that was new to address the problem\nWhat you found\nWhat are the implications of your finding for science or humanity\nAny actions people should take as a result of your research\n\nAnother key style point is to write for a generalist audience (e.g. avoid jargon), even if you are aiming it at specialists. Making it easier for specialists to read will mean they are more likely to read it too.\n\n\n\nNaturally you are already on my blog, so check out some of my blogs about research papers e.g. here.\nI also recommend you check out the Australian Rivers Institute Catchment to Coast blog.\nIn my talk I will give the example of Tyson Martin’s post as a recent one that emphasises signficance in an easily accessible way.\nI love The Conversation. Their blogs are written for a generalist audience - their style guide encourages readibility for highschool students, but even discpline experts can learn a lot from this blog.\nIn fact, I reckon one of their main followings is probably scientists. So you will reach your colleagues as well as a broader audience if you write for The Conversation.\nThe Conversation does blogs about research papers, but also emphasises topical issues too.\nFor instance, a couple examples I give in my seminar are The 2017 budget has axed research to help Australia adapt to climate change and Could ‘nitrogen trading’ help the Great Barrier Reef?.\nIf you want to learn how to blog about opinons or interesting facts as an individual, try these two entertaining ecologically orientated blogs:\nScientist Sees Squirrel\nDynamic Ecology\nA few other professional blogs for places to get ideas are: Cool Green Science and Hakai Magazine.\nHakai Magazine, Cool Green Science and The Conversation all accept ‘pitches’ for new articles from scientists. So if you have a great paper coming out, or have an informed opinion on a topical event, write them and ask to blog about it.\n\n\n\nTo get started, here are a couple of good examples of tweets about research papers: 1. This one by Simon Linke 2. This one by Gretta Pecl\nSome things to notice are:\n\nThey link to their research papers\nBoth have engaging images, which will increase the number of people interacting with your tweet\nBoth have short catchy statements\nSimon Linke’s is notable because he has just started on Twitter and has less than 100 followers, but the tweet has been pretty successful (18 retweets when I last checked) for a research paper tweet.\nBoth share promote their own science, but are not boastful about it and people like that.\nGretta’s post also ties into a hashtag (#BillMeetScienceTwitter) that was trending at the time.\n\nThere are a number of different Twitter strategies you can take, or mix and match. Here are some examples:\n\nSharing personal views e.g. here\nNews and topic expert e.g. here\nScience commmunicator e.g. here\nThe conversationalist e.g. here\nNew publications (often anonymous)e.g. here\nTweet and blog combo That’s what I do!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to thinking about how social media can benefit your research career, its worth thinking about potential costs.\nWhile it can be time-efficient and cost-effective (i.e. no plane flights required to talk with overseas colleagues) way to communicate, it can also be a time sink. Personally, I only leave myself a limited amount of time for social media. e.g. I tweet on the bus and I usually set myself an hour max to finish a blog.\nI think writing fast blogs can actually help make you a more efficient scientific writer.\nAnother potential risk in expanding your communication network is that some people might not like what you have to say. While some people thrive of confrontation, other people (like me!) feel uncomfortable about it.\nCommonsense prevails here. Be courteous, acknowledge other people’s views and keep your conversations professional.\nAn extreme case of confrontation is getting trolled. That is someone who deliberately sets out to demean your views and offend you. Good general advice is to ignore trolls, they are looking for a response. Most social media platforms offer a blocking option too, so you might want to use that.\nI will say that people’s experiences of social media will vary depending on context. In particular, I know a lot of female colleagues are concerned about sexism. Unfortunately, if you are a women and become a well known communicator you will almost certainly recieve sexist comments.\nI don’t want to put women off of using social media. Instead, I hope we can encourage a more forthright conversation about appropriate behaviour on social media. I also want to highlight this issue to men, who may not be aware of it. Guys, be supportive of your female colleagues engaging with public communication. You can help by calling people out on sexist comments (here’s one recent example).\nSocial media can also be a force for good when it comes to sexism. For instance, two women who submitted an article to PLoS One recieved a review saying the paper would be better with a male coauthor.\nTweets about their experience resulted in public outrage from the scientific community. Ultimately the handing editor was asked to step down from PLoS and PLoS has reviewed its reviewing practices.\nSo social media can help level the playing field and improve equity in scientific careers.\n\n\n\nHope you found this helpful. Have fun out there on the network.\nIn short, successful scientists are good networkers. Social media helps us enhance our networks."

    "text": "What defines a (successful) scientist? Their collaborations, their Phd supervisor, their students, who they cite, conferences they attend and citations of their publications all indicate what field they belong to and how successfull they are as a researcher.\nIn short, scientists are defined by their network of influence.\nThis is a brief blog on using social media to enhance your research network. It has been prepared as a supplement for my talk at the Australian Rivers Institute (13/6/2017), but should also stand alone.\n\n\nA great way to learn how to blog is to start copying the style of other people who are good at it.\nA good way to find out who is good at blogging (or social media in general) is to look at the Altmetrics for your favourite papers.\nAltmetrics will give you a influence score for a paper that includes among other things the number of blogs it could detect. You can get a handy link for your browser to quickly view Altmetrics here.\nIf you have your own blog, make sure you get it registered with Altmetrics. Also make sure you include a link or DOI for your paper in the blog.\nThere are many ways to write a blog, but to start I recommend writing about one of your research articles. You want to hit the points below, making sure that the significance of the work, the problem you addressed and the solutions are given priority. Methods and detailed lit review are less important (or don’t even include them!):\nA reasonable blog structure:\n\nThe significance of the work to a generalist audience.\nWhat you did that was new to address the problem\nWhat you found\nWhat are the implications of your finding for science or humanity\nAny actions people should take as a result of your research\n\nAnother key style point is to write for a generalist audience (e.g. avoid jargon), even if you are aiming it at specialists. Making it easier for specialists to read will mean they are more likely to read it too.\n\n\n\nNaturally you are already on my blog, so check out some of my blogs about research papers e.g. here.\nI also recommend you check out the Australian Rivers Institute Catchment to Coast blog.\nIn my talk I will give the example of Tyson Martin’s post as a recent one that emphasises signficance in an easily accessible way.\nI love The Conversation. Their blogs are written for a generalist audience - their style guide encourages readibility for highschool students, but even discpline experts can learn a lot from this blog.\nIn fact, I reckon one of their main followings is probably scientists. So you will reach your colleagues as well as a broader audience if you write for The Conversation.\nThe Conversation does blogs about research papers, but also emphasises topical issues too.\nFor instance, a couple examples I give in my seminar are The 2017 budget has axed research to help Australia adapt to climate change and Could ‘nitrogen trading’ help the Great Barrier Reef?.\nIf you want to learn how to blog about opinons or interesting facts as an individual, try these two entertaining ecologically orientated blogs:\nScientist Sees Squirrel\nDynamic Ecology\nA few other professional blogs for places to get ideas are: Cool Green Science and Hakai Magazine.\nHakai Magazine, Cool Green Science and The Conversation all accept ‘pitches’ for new articles from scientists. So if you have a great paper coming out, or have an informed opinion on a topical event, write them and ask to blog about it.\n\n\n\nTo get started, here are a couple of good examples of tweets about research papers: 1. This one by Simon Linke 2. This one by Gretta Pecl\nSome things to notice are:\n\nThey link to their research papers\nBoth have engaging images, which will increase the number of people interacting with your tweet\nBoth have short catchy statements\nSimon Linke’s is notable because he has just started on Twitter and has less than 100 followers, but the tweet has been pretty successful (18 retweets when I last checked) for a research paper tweet.\nBoth share promote their own science, but are not boastful about it and people like that.\nGretta’s post also ties into a hashtag (#BillMeetScienceTwitter) that was trending at the time.\n\nThere are a number of different Twitter strategies you can take, or mix and match. Here are some examples:\n\nSharing personal views e.g. here\nNews and topic expert e.g. here\nScience commmunicator e.g. here\nThe conversationalist e.g. here\nNew publications (often anonymous)e.g. here\nTweet and blog combo That’s what I do!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to thinking about how social media can benefit your research career, its worth thinking about potential costs.\nWhile it can be time-efficient and cost-effective (i.e. no plane flights required to talk with overseas colleagues) way to communicate, it can also be a time sink. Personally, I only leave myself a limited amount of time for social media. e.g. I tweet on the bus and I usually set myself an hour max to finish a blog.\nI think writing fast blogs can actually help make you a more efficient scientific writer.\nAnother potential risk in expanding your communication network is that some people might not like what you have to say. While some people thrive of confrontation, other people (like me!) feel uncomfortable about it.\nCommonsense prevails here. Be courteous, acknowledge other people’s views and keep your conversations professional.\nAn extreme case of confrontation is getting trolled. That is someone who deliberately sets out to demean your views and offend you. Good general advice is to ignore trolls, they are looking for a response. Most social media platforms offer a blocking option too, so you might want to use that.\nI will say that people’s experiences of social media will vary depending on context. In particular, I know a lot of female colleagues are concerned about sexism. Unfortunately, if you are a women and become a well known communicator you will almost certainly recieve sexist comments.\nI don’t want to put women off of using social media. Instead, I hope we can encourage a more forthright conversation about appropriate behaviour on social media. I also want to highlight this issue to men, who may not be aware of it. Guys, be supportive of your female colleagues engaging with public communication. You can help by calling people out on sexist comments (here’s one recent example).\nSocial media can also be a force for good when it comes to sexism. For instance, two women who submitted an article to PLoS One recieved a review saying the paper would be better with a male coauthor.\nTweets about their experience resulted in public outrage from the scientific community. Ultimately the handing editor was asked to step down from PLoS and PLoS has reviewed its reviewing practices.\nSo social media can help level the playing field and improve equity in scientific careers.\n\n\n\nHope you found this helpful. Have fun out there on the network.\nIn short, successful scientists are good networkers. Social media helps us enhance our networks."

The second function processes the output (which is in JSON format) to make a nice qmd, with the references hyper-linked (be sure to check the url before clicking them, who knows what the AI will turn up!). From there you can render the qmd to get a pdf/word/html report.\nThe functions are easy to use. First download or copy these functions from my github.\nNote never trust any code from someone else that sends requests to LLMs! It could potentially include harmful prompts. I recommend reading all code that is sending prompts to LLMs just to be sure you know what it does."

Note one minor bug with my function converting qmd references to hyperlinks, it potential does R sub-scripts as well. Something to work on later. Here’s the AI report:\nYou can fit a surplus production model (SPM) with the NIMBLE package in R by writing the model in BUGS language, which NIMBLE extends, specifying your likelihood (e.g., production dynamics with catch data) and priors for the parameters, and then using NIMBLE’s MCMC capabilities to estimate the posterior distributions of parameters. Here is a stepwise approach with example code snippets:\n\nSpecify the surplus production model in BUGS code:\nThis typically models biomass ( B_t ) evolving over time according to a logistic growth or Gompertz model minus catches ( C_t ). For example, the Schaefer model can be expressed as:\n[ B_{t+1} = B_t + r B_t (1 - ) - C_t + _t ]\nwhere (r) is intrinsic growth rate, (K) is carrying capacity, and (_t) models process noise.\n\nlibrary(nimble)\n\n# Define the model in BUGS syntax\nspm_code &lt;- nimbleCode({\n  # Priors for parameters\n  r ~ dunif(0, 2)           # growth rate\n  K ~ dunif(maxCatch, 10 * maxCatch)  # carrying capacity (expand as appropriate)\n  sigma ~ dunif(0, 5)       # process noise SD\n\n  B&lt;a href=\"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/banana-book/intronimble.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; ~ dunif(0, K)       # initial biomass\n  \n  for(t in 1:(nYears - 1)) {\n    mu[t] &lt;- B[t] + r * B[t] * (1 - B[t]/K) - catch[t]\n    B[t + 1] ~ dnorm(mu[t], sd = sigma)\n  }\n})\n\nPrepare the data and constants (e.g., catch time series, number of years):\n\ndata &lt;- list(catch = catch_vector)  # your observed catches\nconstants &lt;- list(nYears = length(catch_vector), maxCatch = max(catch_vector))\ninits &lt;- list(r = 0.5, K = max(catch_vector)*5, sigma = 0.1, B = rep(NA, length(catch_vector)))\n\nBuild, compile, and run the model with NIMBLE:\n\n# Create model object\nspm_model &lt;- nimbleModel(spm_code, data = data, inits = inits, constants = constants)\n\n# Compile model\nc_spm_model &lt;- compileNimble(spm_model)\n\n# Configure MCMC; default samplers are usually fine\nmcmc_conf &lt;- configureMCMC(spm_model)\nmcmc &lt;- buildMCMC(mcmc_conf)\nc_mcmc &lt;- compileNimble(mcmc, project = spm_model)\n\n# Run MCMC sampling\nsamples &lt;- runMCMC(c_mcmc, niter = 10000, nburnin = 2000, thin = 5)\n\n# Check results\nsummary(samples)\nThis workflow follows NIMBLE’s general approach of specifying hierarchical Bayesian models in an extended BUGS language, compiling fast C++ versions of the model and samplers, and running MCMC algorithms[1][2][4][7]. The key is coding the surplus production dynamics explicitly as state-transition equations with observation or process error as needed.\nFor clarity, here is a minimal example with dummy catch data:\nlibrary(nimble)\n\ncatch_vector &lt;- c(100, 120, 90, 80, 110) # example catches\n\nspm_code &lt;- nimbleCode({\n  r ~ dunif(0, 2)\n  K ~ dunif(maxCatch, 10 * maxCatch)\n  sigma ~ dunif(0, 5)\n\n  B&lt;a href=\"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/banana-book/intronimble.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; ~ dunif(0, K)\n  for(t in 1:(nYears - 1)) {\n    mu[t] &lt;- B[t] + r * B[t] * (1 - B[t]/K) - catch[t]\n    B[t+1] ~ dnorm(mu[t], sd = sigma)\n  }\n})\n\ndata &lt;- list(catch = catch_vector)\nconstants &lt;- list(nYears = length(catch_vector), maxCatch = max(catch_vector))\ninits &lt;- list(r = 0.5, K = max(catch_vector)*5, sigma = 0.1, B = rep(NA, length(catch_vector)))\n\nspm_model &lt;- nimbleModel(spm_code, data = data, inits = inits, constants = constants)\nc_spm_model &lt;- compileNimble(spm_model)\n\nmcmc_conf &lt;- configureMCMC(spm_model)\nmcmc &lt;- buildMCMC(mcmc_conf)\nc_mcmc &lt;- compileNimble(mcmc, project = spm_model)\n\nsamples &lt;- runMCMC(c_mcmc, niter = 5000, nburnin = 1000, thin = 2)\nprint(summary(samples))\nThis example models biomass dynamics probabilistically and fits parameters (r), (K), and noise level () given known catches using Bayesian inference.\nIf you want to implement maximum likelihood fitting instead, NIMBLE lets you compile the model and evaluate likelihoods for optimization, as demonstrated in tutorials[1].\nIn summary: - Write your surplus production model in NIMBLE’s BUGS language, defining biomass dynamics, catch, and priors for parameters\n- Compile and run MCMC sampling in NIMBLE to fit the model\n- Extract posterior samples for growth rate, carrying capacity, biomass, and uncertainty\n- Optionally, use likelihood-based methods by compiling the model and defining your own optimizer function in R[1][7].\nThis approach leverages NIMBLE’s power for hierarchical, Bayesian time-series stock assessment models including surplus production models."

    "title": "How to solve common problems with GAMs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Here I’ll provide solutions to some common problems I run into when fitting GAMs with mgcv and ways to solve them. The four problems are:\n\nCategorical variables should be input to gam() as factors\nAdjust the degrees of freedom parameter to avoid an error involving the maximum degrees of freedom\nUse the REML method for smaller datasets to avoid overfitting\nHow to deal with crazy extrapolations of a response when there are large gaps in measurements of a covariate\n\n\n\nCategorical variables can cause errors if they are not specified in dataframes as character vectors, and not as factors. But mgcv is inconsistent about whether you need to use factors or not. It is always safest to declare categorical variables as factors if using mgcv.\nOddly character vectors are fine if the categorical variable is included as an additive term like:\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(x) + group)\nBut if you want the spline to vary by groups like this:\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y ~ group + s(x, by = group))\nYou will get this obscure error message:\nError in smoothCon(split$smooth.spec[[i]], data, knots, absorb.cons,\n    scale.penalty = scale.penalty, : Can't find by variable\nThe solution is as simple as changing the class of your categorical variable before using the GAM: dat$group &lt;- factor(dat$group).\nThe new version of R (&gt;4.0) defaults to reading in external dataframes with stringsAsFactors == FALSE meaning it reads categorical variables in as characters, not factors. Factors can be more annoying than characters for many other reasons, so watch out for this error with your GAM code.\n\n\n\nThe default settings for GAM smooths is to try and estimate the degrees of freedom (which controls the ‘wiggliness’) from the data. But this routine can fail if you many more replicates than levels in the smooth. Consider this data:\n\nWe have ten replicates for each of 5 levels of x. Data like this is common in experimental settings.\nIf I try fit a GAM with default settings I get an error:\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(x), data = dat)\n\n## Error in smooth.construct.tp.smooth.spec(object, dk$data, dk$knots):\nA term has fewer unique covariate combinations than specified maximum\ndegrees of freedom\nMeaning the GAM has failed to construct a sensible smooth term for this data. You can limit the maximum df of the smooth using the k parameter:\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(x, k = 3), data = dat)\nNow my GAM fits fine and looks like this:\n\nIf you want to force the GAM to fit a smooth a specific degrees of freedom, then use fx = TRUE:\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(x, k = 4, fx = TRUE), data = dat)\nThe above code forces the GAM to fit with exactly k-1 = 2 an effective DF (EDF in the gam summary).\n\n\n\nThe default method for fitting in GAM tends to overfit smaller datasets. Overfitting tends to look like spline fits that are too wiggly.\nHow you define ‘small’ depends on variation and effect sizes in your data WRT the model, but generally sample sizes smaller than 100s to 1000s of samples ‘small’ in this context.\nThis overfitting is well known and is described in Simon Wood’s classic book on GAMs and mgcv.\nHere’s an example. Say you were expecting a smooth, but non-linear, fit to your data. You use a GAM, but you get a result like this:\n\nThose bumps in the curve cannot be justified by any a-priori knowledge you have about the system you are studying. So you’d like a smoother fit.\nThe default method uses generalized cross validation to fit the smooth. The restricted maximum likelihood method is more robust for small sample sizes. So generally in ecological datasets you’ll want to specify the “REML” method like this:\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y~ s(x), method = \"REML\", data = dat)\nNow our smooth looks like a more reasonable linear slope:\n\nNow your trend reduces to a straight linear trend.\n\n\n\nGaps in an x-covariate, such as gaps in a time-series, can be a problem to deal with if you are trying to interpolate to those gaps.\nQuoting from my last blog about interpolation with GAMs:\nThere is no straightforward answer to solving this problem. The answer depends on what you know about the system from prior work. Ideally you’d collect more data for the intermediate x values, but if that is not possible here are some options:\n\nKeep the result above if you have reason to believe there truly is a hump shaped relationship between x and y. If you that x causes y and have a theory for that relationship then the extrapolation of y values might be reasonable. This theory would be based on prior work on the two variables.\nKeep the fit above but refrain from making predictions in the gap.\nTry a different basis spline for the smooth. See ?smooth.terms for options\nModify the smoother to have a first order, not second order, penalty. See my last blog for an explanation. You’ll get a fit like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a detailed explanation.\nFirst generate some data. We’ll simulate some data y that is related to x via a polynomial (hump shaped) function. Then there will be three groups in variable grp. Each group has a different mean, which will just offset the three groups on the y-axis from each other. See plot below:\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\nn &lt;- 99\ndat &lt;- data.frame(x = runif(n),\n                  grp = rep(letters[1:3], each = n/3),\n                  cat_effect = rep(c(0, 1, -1), each = n/3))\n\ndat$y &lt;- with(dat, 7*x -8*x^2 + cat_effect + rnorm(n, sd = 0.1))\n\nggplot(dat) +\n  aes(x = x, y = y, color = grp)  +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_classic()\n First we’ll fit a model that fits a spline to x and estimates a constant additive term for each group. This should provide a good fit to the original data, because it is very close to the model we used to generate the data. The splines should be able to approximate the polynomial and the categorical will allow for each group’s curve to be offset.\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y ~s(x) + grp, data = dat)\nThis fits fine, I like to use visreg to view GAM results. This plot will show x on the x-axis, fits on the y-axis and have one panel for each group.\nlibrary(visreg)\nvisreg(fit1, xvar = \"x\",\n       by = \"grp\", data = dat,\n       method = \"REML\")\n\nNow say we want to compare this to a model where we allow splines to vary for each group. This model looks like this:\nfit2 &lt;- gam(y ~s(x, by = grp) + grp, data = dat)\n\n## Error in smoothCon(split$smooth.spec[[i]], data, knots, absorb.cons,\n    scale.penalty = scale.penalty, : Can't find by variable\nWhich gives us an error. So simply convert the group to a factor (here I declare a new variable) and use that:\ndat$grp2 &lt;- factor(dat$grp)\nfit2 &lt;- gam(y ~s(x, by = grp2) + grp2, data = dat)\nvisreg(fit2, xvar = \"x\",\n       by = \"grp\", data = dat,\n       method = \"REML\")\n\nNow it works fine."

Overfitting tends to look like spline fits that are too wiggly.\nHow you define ‘small’ depends on variation and effect sizes in your data WRT the model, but generally sample sizes smaller than 100s to 1000s of samples ‘small’ in this context.\nThis overfitting is well known and is described in Simon Wood’s classic book on GAMs and mgcv.\nHere’s an example. Say you were expecting a smooth, but non-linear, fit to your data. You use a GAM, but you get a result like this:\n\nThose bumps in the curve cannot be justified by any a-priori knowledge you have about the system you are studying. So you’d like a smoother fit.\nThe default method uses generalized cross validation to fit the smooth. The restricted maximum likelihood method is more robust for small sample sizes. So generally in ecological datasets you’ll want to specify the “REML” method like this:\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y~ s(x), method = \"REML\", data = dat)\nNow our smooth looks like a more reasonable linear slope:\n\nNow your trend reduces to a straight linear trend."

    "text": "Here is a detailed explanation.\nFirst generate some data. We’ll simulate some data y that is related to x via a polynomial (hump shaped) function. Then there will be three groups in variable grp. Each group has a different mean, which will just offset the three groups on the y-axis from each other. See plot below:\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\nn &lt;- 99\ndat &lt;- data.frame(x = runif(n),\n                  grp = rep(letters[1:3], each = n/3),\n                  cat_effect = rep(c(0, 1, -1), each = n/3))\n\ndat$y &lt;- with(dat, 7*x -8*x^2 + cat_effect + rnorm(n, sd = 0.1))\n\nggplot(dat) +\n  aes(x = x, y = y, color = grp)  +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_classic()\n First we’ll fit a model that fits a spline to x and estimates a constant additive term for each group. This should provide a good fit to the original data, because it is very close to the model we used to generate the data. The splines should be able to approximate the polynomial and the categorical will allow for each group’s curve to be offset.\nfit1 &lt;- gam(y ~s(x) + grp, data = dat)\nThis fits fine, I like to use visreg to view GAM results. This plot will show x on the x-axis, fits on the y-axis and have one panel for each group.\nlibrary(visreg)\nvisreg(fit1, xvar = \"x\",\n       by = \"grp\", data = dat,\n       method = \"REML\")\n\nNow say we want to compare this to a model where we allow splines to vary for each group. This model looks like this:\nfit2 &lt;- gam(y ~s(x, by = grp) + grp, data = dat)\n\n## Error in smoothCon(split$smooth.spec[[i]], data, knots, absorb.cons,\n    scale.penalty = scale.penalty, : Can't find by variable\nWhich gives us an error. So simply convert the group to a factor (here I declare a new variable) and use that:\ndat$grp2 &lt;- factor(dat$grp)\nfit2 &lt;- gam(y ~s(x, by = grp2) + grp2, data = dat)\nvisreg(fit2, xvar = \"x\",\n       by = \"grp\", data = dat,\n       method = \"REML\")\n\nNow it works fine."

The terra documentation states “can do more, is simpler to use, and it is faster.”\nSo should you make the switch to terra? I’ll answer that here.\nTLDR: terra is simpler and faster than raster and will be easy for existing raster users to learn. Compatibility with other packages can be an issue, but conversion back to raster objects is easy. Verdict: make the switch.\nThere are a few important considerations when changing packages:\n\nHow long will it take me to learn the new syntax?\nHow much help is available online?\nIs it faster than what I used to use?\nWill it be compatible with other packages I use?\n\nI will test each in turn.\n\n\nWe’ll use this data from one of my courses.\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s take a look at some basic syntax and compare it with raster\nYou can read in data much the same way, with the command rast():\nlibrary(terra)\nr &lt;- rast(\"data-for-course/spatial-data/MeanAVHRRSST.grd\")\nplot(r)\n\next(r)\n\n## SpatExtent : 82.5, 181.25, -72.25, -9.75 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\nNow let’s crop and reproject it:\n#create an extent object\next2 &lt;- ext(r)\n\n#constrain it in x direction\next2[1] &lt;- 120\next2[2] &lt;- 170\n\nr2 &lt;- crop(r, ext2)\n\nr3 &lt;- project(r2, \"+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0\")\n\nplot(r3)\n\nSo much of the syntax is familiar (or identical), if slightly different.

A key one for me is tmap for mapping. This now works with terra.\nBut at the time of first writing this post my version of tmap was out of date and terra wasn’t compatible with tmap.

By publishing these findings and engaging with media and apps, scientists can motivate restoration efforts.\nOpen Data: Making data freely available allows for its reuse in various contexts. For instance, biodiversity credit markets can use open data to finance conservation projects. This approach aligns with global goals to halt biodiversity loss, double protection efforts, and restore ecosystems.\nCodevelop Science with Policy Makers: Collaborating with policy makers and NGOs ensures that scientific research informs and supports policy decisions. The Global Wetlands Project work has been used by organizations like WWF to develop strategies for mangrove conservation and community engagement.\n\nEngaging with NGOs and Policy Makers\nIts important to engage with NGOs and policy makers to ensure that scientific research translates into actionable policies. By providing data and tools, such as the Blue Forests Data Explorer, scientists can help NGOs like WWF make informed decisions about conservation strategies.\nAdvice for Students and Professors\nFor students, I recommend planning a theory of change for your projects, seeking internships, and valuing applied science.

    "text": "Species on the Move Conference: A synopsis of day 3\n12 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania\nYou can read the complete day 1 and day 2 synopses.\nAlso a summary of some key things I learnt.\n\n\n\nThanks to the Species on the Move Sponsors for supporting an exceptional conference. Via Gretta Pecl\n\n\nClimate change impacts are happening now and managers are already responding to them\nTalks today and throughout the conference have highlighted that climate-driven change in ecosystems is already under way. Today we saw a few talks showing that while many scientists debate the suitability of management actions like assisted migration, managers are already making decisions.\nA series of recent fires in southern Australia is driving a state change away from ash forests explained David Bowman. This “Interval squeeze” of more frequent fires combined with slower plant growth will squeeze out some tree species and they can’t just migrate up mountains. Bowman gave an example of two rapid fires were two successional fires caused a state change, because after the second fire there are no seeds for forest recovery and the Eucalyptus species has poor seed dispersal. The third fire locked in a state change. Managers had to make a rapid decision in just a few weeks over what to do. They spread seed during the key season and have probably reversed the state shift.\nTrain managers to respond to short-term climate variability, to improve their skill in decision making for long-term change argued Alistair Hobday. His work on identifying seasonal tuna habitat to help avoid bycatch species, has been used in an increasingly sophisticated way over time as managers become more familiar with the model predictions (note: I have just included one pub, but I recommend contacting Hobday if you want the full story as it covers multiple papers).\nThe prolific tweeter David Watson spoke on linking efforts to improve landscape connectivity for conservation and ecological monitoring two large areas of ecological research that are rarely linked. ‘Connectivity conservation’ is becoming increasingly popular with stakeholders and scientists need to be providing rigorous methods for monitoring their effectiveness.\nMultiple stressors and climate change\nNathalie Pettorelli answered Possingham’s challenge from day 2 that we need to study and model Change, not just Climate Change. She is using satellites to detect human impacts that may interact with climate change to drive biodiversity loss, for instance in desert ecosystems.\nTim Clark is doing exciting experimental work to look at the interactive effect of warming and fishing on coral trout mortality. I won’t say more because I think it is in prep, but a hint, he has his finger on the pulse of fish to learn how they respond to warming and fishing stress.\nThe right models and data are of course key when predicting the effects of multipe-stressors. Lucy Robinson is modelling the distribution of toothfish, to better understand fishing impacts. She found correcting for sampling bias in distribution modelling of toothfish makes a big difference to the predicted effect of temperature on the species.\nA range shift in a lobster on the south-west coast of Africa is driving an ecosystem regime shift on rocky reefs and impacting abalone fisheries, Laura Blamey explained. But an interaction with historical overfishing is also contributing. She used models to ‘rewrite history’ (Plaganyi day 2) and found if predatory fish hadn’t been overfished, this regmie shift may not have happened.\nThe impacts to fisheries are interesting to me, because years ago I naively thought (and others too) the impacts of range shifts on fisheries would not be that significant. If a species moved, fisheries should be mobile enough to follow. That is not how it is playing out. In South Africa Blamey explains, expansion of lobster is creating new opportunities for small scale fisheries but having a large economic impact on the valuable abalone fishery - a different industry that can’t just switch its target species. The transition to a new ecosystem regime can be very painful for society, even if the end point looks ok.\nBlamey’s work illustrates that multiple stressors, including climate change, can drive changes in the functioning of ecosytems, which is the next major theme.\nChanges in the composition and function of ecosystems\nAt a global scale, Jorge Molinos used the velocity of climate change to predict the future redistribution of ocean biodiversity. A strength of using this simple model is that it can encompass many species, here Molinos used the aquamaps data to model almost 13 000 species. Importantly, he took a current marine ecoregionalisation and looked at change in species composition in these regions. Ecoregions won’t be the same in the future. He is working on regional testing of the models, for instance in the work presented on day one by Jan Hiddink.\nIvana Matejickova from Czech Republic is finding a native freshwater fish changes to herbivory at high temperatures. Big implications here - the ecological function of species, which we often assume is constant, changes with warming.\nClimate-driven invasions can lead to the creation of novel ecosystems, the topic of Richard Hobbs’ talk. The invaders can bring new ecological interactions to an ecosystem, changing the way it functions. Research on climate invasions can learn much from invasion ecology. We don’t have a manual yet for managing novel ecosystems and species translocation, but Hobb’s talk highlights that the status-quo isn’t an option.\nThat’s it for today. Check out some lessons we learned by way of a conference summary from me.\n…"

    "text": "Species on the Move Conference: A synopsis of day 2\n11 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania\nHere’s my day two synopsis, covering a few big themes and some of the talks I saw. If you want to know more, check out the book of abstracts. See also my Day 1 synopsis and Michelle Neil’s - storify of the tweets. Here is a summary of some key things I learnt.\nTwo big themes emerging today were\nConservation decisions in a changing climate - We want to know when to translocate species, if we even should translocate them, where we should be putting protected areas to capture climate migrants, how to assist climate-driven migrations, and what to do about other human impacts like harvesting; and\nUnderstanding of range shifts in communities of species - scientists are grappling with how communities of species have changed, how their ecological interactions regulate community change and whether we can predict community change in the future.\n\n\n\nAnother day of extensive media interest directed at Species on the Move. Commendations are deserved for Gretta Pecl and the team for getting the important messages from this conference out there.\n\n\nOne talk stood out for making use cutting edge techniques to address a really big picture question: Julia Blanchard is charting the future of sustainability of human food using (ecological) community modelling approaches. Blanchard’s work is far ahead of the curve. Miguel Arajuo, leading SDMer, posed a rhetorical question - how would you assess the future of biodiversity? He spent the last 16 years of his career answering this question with species distribution models. He ended his talk by suggesting if he were to do it all again he would start with a community/ecosystem approach. Well, Blanchard is making great strides in achieving global ecosystem models that are relevant to a no smaller problem than the future of sustainability of the human species.\nI won’t say more, because the work is unpublished, but check out some of her earlier work on community modelling. This is certainly a space to watch.\nConservation decisions in a changing climate\nHugh Possingham led the keynotes, reminding us to remember the big picture of conservation- it is not just climate change we need to model/predict/adapt to, there is widespread Change in society, economies and the environment.\nTracy Rout’s work was a great introduction to decision science for assisted colonisation of range shifting species. She showed how a transparent decision framework (open access pub) can help us work out what we need to know if we are translocating a species. Her work highlights that decision science can be most useful when we don’t know much about a system, because it helps us identify the uncertainties that matter for conservation.\n\n\n\nA decision tree for deciding whether to move species threatened by climate change from Rout’s paper in PLoS One (open access).\n\n\nJoshua Lawler showed how we can include climate change in cost-effective priorities for reserve placement. I won’t say more because I think this work is yet to be published.\nOn a positive note Timothy Bonebrake predicts that the recovery of an endangered spoonbill will be slowed, but not reversed, by climate change. His talked also weaved in his work on plant conservation under climate change.\nFishing industries will also be affected by range shifts. Eva Plaganyi argued that models can help us ‘re-write history’ so we can learn more from past management mistakes. She showed an application to range in lobster in South Africa, which is impacting on valuable abalone fisheries. Her protege Viv Tulloch, is working on similar models to predict the future recovery (or not) of southern ocean whales.\nGuilia Porra, Aus Fishery Management Authority biologist and foodie of Love at Every Bite fame talked about management approaches the Aus Government is taking for fisheries to address range shifting species.\nUnderstanding and predicting change in whole communities was another major theme\n‘Species’ distribution modelling is moving from species to community focussed approaches. We saw several novel ways of modelling change in whole communities of species.\nThe community thermal index was highlighted in several talks. Rick Stuart-Smith and team have shown that there are thermal biases in fish communities, with most fish species being either associated with temperate or tropical conditions. This has implications for the effects of ocean warming on whole communities, as communities near their thermal limits may suffer large species losses. Mike Burrows is also using the community index to investigate sensitivity of different communities to warming.\n\n\n\n\nSpecies on the Move is helping turn the tide on gender inequity in science by promoting #WomeninSTEM on what is the “International Women in STEM day”: we saw an all female panel during an organised discussion.\n\n\nClimate-driven changes in one ecosystem can affect whole other ecosystems. Megan Saunders showed that responses of tropical seagrass ecosystems to sea level rise depend on whether coral reefs grow upwards, coral reefs shelter seagrass from waves so if corals don’t keep up with sea level rise lagoons may loose seagrass too. A key management policy response is helping coastal ecosystems migrate inland through ‘planned retreat’ of coastal infrastructure. See her video for a fun introduction to this topic\nSome exciting work on modelling community responses is coming out of CSIRO. Bruce Webber introduced a new tool for distinguishing novel environmental ranges from contemporary, to help avoid extrapolation in models. The tool ExDet is available via his blog. Weber also highlighted that the global datasets for temperature and rainfall we use for model fitting have considerable uncertainties. Be careful!\nA keynote from Simon Ferrier, also of CSIRO, highlighted that species composition doesn’t change linearly across environmental gradients, like we often assume it does. Karel Mokany presented meta-community modelling as a solution to this problem, and showed its application to dynamic models of climate-driven shifts in whole plant communities.\n\n\n\nSea-urchin invasion in Tasmania is now a major threatening process - Scott Ling explained.\n\n\nDigging deeper into ecological interactions Miguel Arajuo is finding there are general rules that can explain the assembly of species interactions which can be exploited for distribution modelling of ecological webs.\nA regional example of the importance of species interactions comes from Tasmania, where barrens formed by the climate migration of a sea-urchin have driven a phase-shift from productive kelp habitats to rock, changing the entire reef community: check out the video. Martin Marzloff is modelling the dynamics of this system to understand where the tipping point occurs for canopy loss. Scott Ling talked about how evidence for the regime shift and the implications it has for further climate-driven invasions. His latest work is in progress, but check out his latest multi-system study on regime shifts caused by sea-urchins (thanks to Suzanna Mason @SuzannaCMason for being my eyes on the ground for this talk).\nSome taxonomic gaps in understanding of range shifts are being filled in\nSeveral talks have highlighted the large number of taxonomic and temporal gaps in our sampling of range shifting species. Several talks today worked to fill the gaps. Julian Olden is looking at range shifts in freshwater fish, an under-studied group. I won’t say more because the work is cutting edge and in prep.\nFinally, to wrap up on a bit of fun, Robert Colwell presented in prep work on a new model of niche evolution. I won’t give away his exciting results, except to say he made use of exceptional animations. Several commentators on twitter suggested there should be an award for best animations in a talk and that Colwell would win it."

    "title": "How to think like an economist",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How conservation biologists can think like economists\nIf you are a conservation biologist at some point you will probably find yourself writing about $. Conservation often requires restricting people’s use of natural resources, at least in the short-term. Also funds for conservation are limited. So as we recently wrote about* if we can find ways to make conservation cheaper, we can often protect more species, habitats and ecosystems. Writing about money is difficult, particularly if like me, you were trained in the biological sciences. This is where I have got into trouble. I have had several papers (fairly) rejected when they were reviewed by economists. I went back to the drawing board and have eventually had some of them published. So, to avoid this happening to you, (and to remind myself for next time) here are a few tips for how to think like an economist if you are a biological scientist.\n\n\nTip 1 Consult a professional\nThis goes without saying. The problem is often finding an economist who has time or is willing to help. I have been lucky in a few collaborations. In general though, when I have managed to corner an economist, they have been quite keen to talk, given what they see as a disappointing ignorance of economics amongst biological scientists.\n\n\nTip 2 Get your terms right\nConsult a basic economics text book before you use words like ‘cost’, ‘value’ and ‘profit’. We use these everyday in colloquial language, but economists attach special meanings to these words. I won’t try to define them here in case I get it wrong, but as an example, value might be what you make from harvesting a resource before you factor in costs, whereas profit = value - costs. Also, don’t forget that values can be also be non-monetary, like cultural values. If you use the word ‘value’ in an ecological context, like the value of prey nutrition to predator growth, be sure you make the context clear. Otherwise, you will set alarm bells ringing when it appears you have mis-used an economic term.\n\n\nTip 3 Ask yourself how costs, profits might vary\nAs biologists, we are interested in the causes of variability in nature. For instance, in my models of fish populations I ask how interactions among predators and prey vary over space and time. Sometimes, this variability has implications for the profitability of fisheries, for instance when we overfish prey species to the detriment of their predators. Well you might have done something very clever with modelling predators and prey that an ecologist would be imminently impressed with, but if you article is reviewed by an economist they probably won’t care much.\nThe economist might criticize you for not having the price of the predator fish change with supply of that fish or, ask why fishing industries should care about a benefit 50 years down the road when they only think about next year’s profits (high discount rates). Obviously, economists are interested in the causes of variability in economies. So your work in conservation biology should address the main causes of variability in economies, like how supply and demand affect prices. It is often enough to approach economic dynamics in a relatively simplistic way, as long as you think about it. After all, your main focus is probably still the biological dynamics.\n\n\nTip 4 Optimise something\nEconomists, especially the mathematically minded theoretical type, like to know what the optimal solution is. For instance, what arrangement of protected areas protects the most species for the cheapest cost? Of course, the optimal solution should also account for some important economic dynamics, like changes in the value of resources over time (e.g. discount rates).\n\n\nTip 5 Have a hard look at the economics literature\nWhatever you are doing, you will probably find out that some economist has analysed the same problem 20 years ago (I did when I wrote about the economics of restoring fisheries using marine reserves). Of course, it is hard to search the economics literature when they often use very different terms than biologists. I have been lucky so far in having helpful economists review my papers and point out those references I couldn’t have possibly found myself. Of course, the best thing to do would be to work with an economist that knows that literature from the outset.\n\n\nConservation biologists should think more about the cost of conservation for society\nAs conservation biologists we need to think more about the cost of conservation on society than we currently do. Often doing so results in new insights and findings that can help make conservation science more realistic to real world situations. We might even find ways that conservation can be profitable to society. So go forth, collaborate with economists and good luck!\n\nthe irony of writing about how my articles have been rejected in the face of criticism on their economics, a month after we published an article criticizing others for ignoring economics, is not lost on me. We can all do better."

    "section": "",
    "text": "See the other parts in this series of blog posts.\nIn parts 1 and 2 we extracted spatial coordinates from our photos and then made an interactive web map that included data associate with those photos. Here I describe how we can build a spatial statistical model to interpolate to unmeasured locations.\nHere we will build an interactive map showing model results from an interpolation of oyster presence/absence.\n\nIt no map appears here your browser doesn’t support iframes. Try &lt;a href = \"/data/hornby_oysters_interp.html\"&gt;this link instead&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGet the data for this blog.\nFirst up we need to load some packages:\n    library(readr)\n    library(INLA)\n    library(sp)\n    library(raster)\n    library(rgeos)\nThe INLA package is crucial here. We will be using INLA to perform Bayesian Kriging. In non-technical terms, Bayesian kriging lets us fill in the gaps between observations of oyster counts by interpolating from nearby points.\n\n\nBefore we begin, we need to load in the data, and transform it into a spatial data frame. In particular, it is important to transform the lon-lats into UTM coordinates. UTM coordinates allow us to measure distances between sample sites in metres:\n    dat &lt;- read_csv('Oysters_merged.csv')\n    n &lt;- nrow(dat)\n    utmproj &lt;- \"+proj=utm +zone=10 +north +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0\"\n    spdat &lt;- dat\n    coordinates(spdat) &lt;- ~ GPSLongitude + GPSLatitude\n    proj4string(spdat) &lt;- \"+init=epsg:4326\"\n    spdf &lt;- spTransform(spdat, CRS(utmproj))\n    plot(spdf)\n\nYou should get a plot like that pictured just of the sample sites.\n\n\n\nNow we can start building the specialised data-structures we need for the INLA package. First up, we have to build what’s called a mesh. This is a Delaunay triangulation built around our data points. It accounts for the non-regular spatial structuring of the sampling (I wandered around on the rocky shore throwing the quadrat at intervals).\nBelow we provide two parameters to max.edge, this will enable us to buffer the edges to obtain a slightly larger spatial domain. Buffering is important because the INLA approximation will be inaccurate at the edges of the spatial domain.\nmax.edge.length &lt;- c(25, 40)\nloc1 &lt;- as.matrix(coordinates(spdf))\nmesh &lt;- inla.mesh.2d(loc=loc1, max.edge = max.edge.length, offset=1, cutoff = 5)\n\nplot(mesh)\nplot(spdf, add = T, col = 'red')\n\nYou can play with the edge length, offset and cutoff parameters to vary how the triangulations turns out.\nYou can get more guidance at the INLA page and in this tutorial. This tutorial also has some very excellent advice about how to choose boundaries and triangle sizes.\nAn important step is to check that our maximum edge lengths are less than the estimated range (otherwise it is pointless including a spatial effect!). We will check the range size below, once we have fitted the model.\nYou might like to think of a-prior reasons for modelling a certain range, for instance, what is a reasonable spatial scale for ‘clumping’ of oyster patches?\n\n\n\nNow we need to implement a few more steps to build up an appropriate ‘stack’ of data for INLA. Note that I have transformed oyster count to presence - absence. We will build a binomial model and just predict whether any given quadrat had oysters or not.\nA.data &lt;- inla.spde.make.A(mesh, loc1)\nspde &lt;- inla.spde2.matern(mesh, alpha = 2)\nspdf$presabs &lt;- ifelse(spdf$oysters_live&gt;0, 1, 0)\n\nstk &lt;- inla.stack(data=list(y=spdf$presabs), A=list(A.data, 1),\n                  effects=list(s=1:mesh$n, intercept=rep(1, n)),\n                  remove.unused = FALSE, tag = \"est\")\nNote that here we choose alpha = 2. alpha is a smoothness parameter that must be 0 &lt;= alpha &lt;= 2, higher values will give smoother spatial interpolation. Also note that we have to specify ‘data’ for the intercept (just a vector of 1).\nThe tag = \"est\" argument just gives a name tag to the fitted model. In other applications you might want to join the estimation stack with a prediction stack (just build two stacks, one where the response is NA and then join them by applying inla.stack to both).\n\n\n\nNow, after that considerable amount of prepartion, we get to fitting the model. We use standard R syntax for the formula, with the addition of the f() term to specify a function.\n    formula &lt;- y ~ 0 + intercept + f(s, model=spde)\n\n    mod &lt;- inla(formula, data=inla.stack.data(stk),\n            control.predictor=list(A = inla.stack.A(stk)),\n            family = 'binomial')\nWe can extract summary parameters using summary. Here we are interested in the random effects, it is good practice to call inla.hyperpar before we inspect random effects:\nhyper &lt;- inla.hyperpar(mod)\nsummary(hyper)\n\n\n\nWe should also check that our triangle edge length is less than the estimated spatial range. We can do that by making a call to the model object, asking for the estimated parameters for the random field\nrf &lt;- inla.spde.result(inla = mod, name = \"s\",\nspde = spde, do.transf = TRUE)\n\nplot(rf$marginals.range[[1]], type = \"l\",\n xlab = \"Range (m)\", ylab = \"Density\",\n xlim = c(0, 1000))\nabline(v = max.edge.length[2], col = 'red')\n\nThe red line shows our edge length parameter, which is well less than the model estimate for the spatial range.\n\n\n\nNow we have a fitted model, we can extracted predicted probabilities of oyster presence and map them. First transform the predictions from the logit scale back to probabilities:\n  ypred &lt;- exp(mod$summary.random$s$mean)/(1 + exp(mod$summary.random$s$mean))\nThen we can turn our predictions into a spatial points, that can be be mapped onto a raster for plotting:\nextent &lt;- extent(spdf)\nxdims &lt;- 100; ydims &lt;- 200\nxlim &lt;- c(extent[1], extent[2]); ylim = c(extent[3], extent[4]);\nproj &lt;- inla.mesh.projector(mesh, xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, dims=c(xdims, ydims))\nfield.proj &lt;- inla.mesh.project(proj, ypred)\n\ndatpred &lt;- data.frame(x = rep(proj$x, ydims), y = rep(proj$y, each = xdims), pred = as.numeric(field.proj))\ncoordinates(datpred) &lt;- ~x + y\n\nproj4string(datpred) &lt;- utmproj\ndat3 &lt;- spTransform(datpred, crs(\"+init=epsg:4326\"))\n\nr &lt;- raster(extent(dat3), ncols = xdims, nrows= ydims, crs = crs(spdat))\nicell &lt;- cellFromXY(r, dat3)\n\nr[icell] &lt;- as.numeric(dat3$pred)\nAnd finally the plot:\ncols &lt;- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, \"Purples\")\nplot(r, col = cols)\npoints(spdf)\nplot(spdat, add = TRUE)\n\nSo it looks like oysters are more common in the southern portion of the survey area.\nBut note that our predictions extent a fair way from the points. We might want to redo these with a more constrained spatial region. In general we should’t trust predictions that are more than ~ 1 spatial range from the edge of our sampled region (in this case the posterior estimate for range was 181m).\nFinally, we could map this onto a satellite image to get a better view of what is going on. I am just using the same leaflet code as before:\nlibrary(leaflet)\nbrks &lt;- seq(0,1, by = 0.1)\nncol &lt;- length(brks)\noystercols &lt;- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(min(ncol, 9), 'Reds')\npal &lt;- colorBin(oystercols, dat$oysters_live, bins = brks)\n\nx1 &lt;- -124.5997\ny1 &lt;- 49.52848\n\nleaflet() %&gt;%\naddProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %&gt;%\n\nsetView(lng = x1, lat = y1, zoom = 16) %&gt;%\naddRasterImage(r, opacity = 0.8, color = pal) %&gt;%\naddCircleMarkers(lng = dat$GPSLongitude, lat = spdat$GPSLatitude,\nradius = 4) %&gt;%\naddLegend(\"topright\", pal = pal,\nvalues = brks,\ntitle = \"Chance of live oysters &lt;a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster' target = '_blank'&gt; (Crassostrea gigas)&lt;/a&gt;\",\nopacity = 1)"

Those photos have data associated with them (counts of oysters in quadrats) so here we will look at how you would plot that data on your map.\nWe will also add a geo-referenced pop-up that includes a picture of our study site. You might be familiar with this idea from Google Earth or Flickr.\nTo get you excited, here is the end result (try clicking on things! If you are viewing this blog on Rbloggers you will need to go here to see the map):\n\nIt no map appears here your browser doesn’t support iframes.

I am using read_csv which comes from the readr package. read_csv is a modernised version of the base R function read.csv. Here are the exif data and associated oyster counts if you are repeating this example.\nedat &lt;- read_csv('Exifdata.csv')\nodat &lt;- read_csv('oyster_data.csv')\nn &lt;- nrow(odat) #number of sample sites\n\n\n\nNow we need to join our counts of oysters to the locations. We can match by the picture numbers, which I recorded when I counted the oysters. First up we need to clean the clean the picture numbers in the exif data to remove the leading ‘DSC_’. We do this using mutate from dplyr and str_extract from stringr to extract the first four digits in each picture’s filename.\nedat&lt;- edat %&gt;%\nmutate(pic_num =\n    as.numeric(\n        str_extract(SourceFile, '\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d')\n        ))\nIf you haven’t seen %&gt;% before it is a ‘pipe’ that puts the dataframe edat into the first argument of our mutate function. The pipe isn’t essential, but I think it improves readibility. See Wickham’s book for more guidance on pipes.\nNow we can join the oysters and pictures. left_join will automatically identify pic_num to join on, because it is the common column across both dataframes:\ndat &lt;- odat %&gt;%\n  left_join(edat)\n\n\n\nTo create the pop-up you need to know a little bit of html. There is plenty of helpful guides on the web and html is pretty simple to learn. The pop-up will show an image and some text. Here we define the content:\ncontent &lt;- paste(sep = \"&lt;br/&gt;\",\n\"&lt;img src='http://www.seascapemodels.orgintertidal_scene.JPG'\n   style='width:230px;height:300px;'&gt;\",\n\"The intertidal zone\",\n\"at Hornby Island\"\n)\nIn short we have specified a string with some html code. &lt;br/&gt; html tag creates a new line. The &lt;img&gt; tag specifies the insertion of an image (the link gives the image’s location, which is on my webpage. We have also set the width and height of the image. Then we follow with a bit of text explaining the image.\nWe will use content in our leaflet map below.\nWe also need the location to place our pop-up. Because the image is gps tagged, we can extract the gps locations from the exif data. Download the image from the link given above in content then you can get the exif data associated with it like this:\nscene &lt;- exifr('intertidal_scene.JPG')\nx1 &lt;- scene $GPSLongitude\ny1 &lt;- scene $GPSLatitude\nWe now have coordinates for the pop-up in our leaflet map.\n\n\n\nleaflet has some pretty convenient functions for creating nice colour scales. Here we use colourBin to bin counts of oysters into different categories that we set in the vector brks:\nbrks &lt;- c(0,1, 5, 10, 20, 70)\nncol &lt;- length(brks)-1\noystercols &lt;- c('grey20',brewer.pal(ncol-1, 'Purples'))\npal &lt;- colorBin(oystercols, dat$oysters_live, bins = brks)\nThe end result pal is a function that will generate a colour palette when some data is input to it.\n\n\n\nWe have prepped our data, so now the fun bit, making the map! This map is somewhat complicated so I will step you through it using our friend ‘pipes’ (the full code without text breaks is below if you want to cut and paste). Note how convenient pipes are here, we can essentially just layer up our map data in an intuitive fashion.\nmapout &lt;- leaflet(dat) %&gt;%\nWe name our map and set the dataframe it will use.\naddProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %&gt;%\nSet’s the background (a satellite image)\nsetView(lng = x1, lat = y1, zoom = 16) %&gt;%\nChooses the region to zoom into. leaflet will guess the zoom level from our dataframe, but we have more control if we choose the region. The default here was a higher zoom level where the tiles don’t render when using Esri.WorldImagery.\nNow we add some markers, setting their colours using oyster counts:\naddCircleMarkers(~ GPSLongitude, ~ GPSLatitude,\n    color = 'white',opacity =1, weight = 1,\nfillColor = ~pal(oysters_live),\npopup = as.character(dat$oysters_live),\nfillOpacity = 0.8,\nradius = 6) %&gt;%\nThis looks complex, but it is just a series of simple commands. ~ GPSLongitude tells leaflet which column of dat is longitude. color, opacity and weight refer to the colour, opacity (solid in this case) and width of the border of the markers. fillColor uses our palette and applies it the oysters_live column of dat. popup creates a popup when we click on a marker, which gives the number of oysters. fillOpacity and radius refer to the fill of the markers.\nWe will also add a marker for the picture I took of the shoreline. Note that this time I use our content data created above to specify what goes in the popup. We also change some of the marker options with options. See ?markerOptions for other options:\naddMarkers(x1, y1, popup = content,\n    options = markerOptions(opacity = 0.9, draggable=T)) %&gt;%\nNow let’s add a legend:\naddLegend(\"topright\", pal = pal,\nvalues = brks,\ntitle = \"Number of live oysters\n&lt;a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster' target = '_blank'&gt; (Crassostrea gigas)&lt;/a&gt;\",\nopacity = 1)\nthe nice thing about using colorBin to create our colours is we can map them directly to the legend, as we have done here with pal = pal (telling leaflet to use our pal function for the colour palette). Note in the title command we have also inserted some more html, this time a &lt;a&gt; tag which just turns the species name ‘(Crassostrea gigas)’ into a link to the Wikipedia page for the Pacific oyster.\nAnd that’s it. Run that code then type mapout to print your map. Next up we will look at how to build a spatial model using this data.\n\n\n\nIf you want to save the map to use on your own page, you can do so with the htmlwidgets package, like this:\nhtmlwidgets::saveWidget(mapout, file = 'hornby_oysters_map.html', selfcontained = F, libdir = \"leafletmap_files\")\nI recommend using `so that the javascript files that create the map are stored in a seperate folder, rather than the javascript code being included within the html page (which makes it a very long file).  Also, if you set thelibdircommand the javascript files will be saved in the folder specified bylibdir` and all the references to the javascript on the html page (which has the map) will be to that folder (in this case: ‘/leafletmap_files/’). If you are putting multiple maps on your webpage, always use the same libdir and you will only need one copy of the leaflet javascript (under libdir) in your page’s data files. Poke around in github.com/cbrown5/cbrown5.github.io if you want to see how this works. I keep the leaflat maps in the data folder.\n\n\n\nmapout &lt;- leaflet(dat) %&gt;%\n#Use satellite image as base\naddProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %&gt;%\nsetView(lng = x1, lat = y1, zoom = 16) %&gt;%\n#Add markers for oyster quadrats\naddCircleMarkers(~ GPSLongitude, ~ GPSLatitude,\n    color = 'white',opacity =1, weight = 1,\n    fillColor = ~pal(oysters_live),\n    popup = as.character(dat$oysters_live),\n    fillOpacity = 0.8,\n    radius = 6) %&gt;% # add a popup for number of oysters\n    #Add marker showing a picture of the survey site\n    addMarkers(x1, y1, popup = content,\n        options = markerOptions(opacity = 0.9, draggable=T)) %&gt;%\n        #Add a legend\n        addLegend(\"topright\", pal = pal,\n        values = brks,\n        title = \"Number of live oysters\n        &lt;a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster' target = '_blank'&gt; (Crassostrea gigas)&lt;/a&gt;\",\n        opacity = 1)"

    "title": "Measuring range shifts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Why do species vary in how fast they shift their ranges?\nIt is well established that species are moving their ranges towards the poles to keep up with global warming. We would like to know how fast species are likely to move, so we can inform policy responses. For instance, how soon will fisheries be affected?\nSpecies on the move is the topic of a major conference this week (10-Feb-2016). There are many talks about identifying range shifts. This is my take on climate range shifts in marine species, based on our recent paper.\n\n\n\nWe want to know how fast species will move under global warming, so we can inform management policy, such as for fisheries of affected species \n\n\nThere is considerable variation in how fast different species are moving. What we don’t know is why species vary. This variation makes predicting range shifts in the future difficult. We can build realistic models of almost 13 000 ocean species to predict changes in species richness under global warming, but we have very few observations to test those predictions against (see figure below). While the general trends from the models might be correct, it is hard to fine tune them without more information on how individual species will respond.\nWe set out to find out why species vary using an analysis of a global database of observed species range shifts. What we found surprised us. We were expecting ecological traits, like a species’ dispersal ability to predict the rate of range shifts. It turned out that the rate of range shifts we measure was more strongly determined by how scientists measured the range shift, than by the traits of the species they measured.\n\n\n\nWe have the  models  to that can generate predictions for a large number of species, but we have very few  observations of range shifts  to test those models against. Finding generalities in species responses, for instance better dispersers may move faster, can help us fine tune the models to get more accurate predictions.\n\n\nThe data we used came from a literature review, that our team conducted during working groups at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. We updated that review and found 485 observations of range shifts, taken from observations of marine species. As a minimum criteria studies had to have observations in the field with a time-span of at least 19 years, to ensure they captured a long-term climate change response, rather than just short-term variation.\nWe asked two main questions with our database:\n\nDo the ecological attributes of a species explain how fast a species range moves in response to climate change?\nDid the methods used to measure a species’ range affect the rate of the range shift that was observed?\n\nWe found the most important predictors of the rate species moved where the type of data (abundance or occurrence) used to measure ranges and how frequently a species’ range was sampled.\nAbundance vs. occurrence measurements were important because they measure different parts of a population’s range shift. Occurrence based measures measured faster range shifts than abundance based measures. Occurrence based measures are influenced by the movement of single individuals, who may represent the extremes of movement, not the norm. They likely pick up on the early colonisers that are extending a species range, but have not yet established new populations. These colonisers can move very rapidly. Abundance based measures focus more on established populations. Because population establishment is slower, rates measured by abundance are also slower.\n\n\n\nAbundance and occurrence surveys measure different rates of range shift because they measure different ecological processes \n\n\nFrequency of sampling was also important. Yearly sampled ranges were observed to move more slowly than resurveys - studies that repeat a historical survey in the present day. This difference may indicate a publication bias in resurveys unintentionally picking places where change has been more extreme.\nWe did find some differences between species’ movements that were attributable to ecological traits. Most importantly, coastal species moved much more slowly than open-ocean species. This may be because coastal species are more constrained in the habitats they can use (e.g. barnacles on rocky shores), so the rate of their range shifts is limited by availability of new habitat to move into.\nOur study has important implications for how we measure and interpret range shifts. While there is no doubt species are responding to ocean warming, we need to be careful about how we measure that change.\nFirst, we should be encouraging resurveys in places that may not be strongly warming. Doing so will give us a more comprehensive picture of which species are moving (or not moving) in response to warming.\nSecond, meta-analyses should control for the methods of studies they analyse. Previous analyses of smaller regions than ours have been successful at identifying traits that predict how species vary. Our analysis encompassed a much broader area (the whole globe), and therefore a broader range of methods for measuring range shifts. If we are going to uncover traits that matter, we need to control for differences in the methods for measuring range shifts in global analyses.\nFinally, the design of new time-series to detect range shifts can be informed by our findings. For instance, surveys of species occurrence may be useful as an ‘early warning’ of new colonisers, by picking up the extreme individuals that respond to warming first. In contrast, surveys of abundance may be most useful for picking up on ecologically significant change, to identify when a new species has established populations in an area."

    "text": "Below is my suggested workflow for using quarto to write scientific papers. I’m currently switching to doing as many projects as possible with quarto rather than word for a few reasons:\n\nEasier to manage document style\nEasier to manage references\nWorkflows that auto-update figures/tables when R code is re-run\nGenerative AI integration that is customizable.\n\nPoint 3 is great, no more cut and pasting figures into word documents!\nPoint 4 is the big one. I’m developing my own ‘writing mentor’ scripts for large language models. Using quarto lets me implement writing advice specific to science direclty into my manuscripts.\nQuarto is ‘What You See is What you Make’, meaning that you write special syntax for formatting. Once you are used to it, this is way easier way to manage styles than word.\nThe downside is getting your (non-coding) collaborators to edit files in quarto. This is the biggest bottleneck to my use of quarto/markdown. Currently I send them word documents then have to manually integrate the feedback. Or I work in quarto until the near final stages, accepting comments only, then get them to edit the final manuscript.\nFor instance, I wrote most of this paper in markdown but had to go to word editing towards the end so I could get edits from my collaborator. Once you’ve progressed it in word, its hard to go back to markdown.\nInstructions below are high level. There are quite a few pieces of software you need to do this, so I’ve linked to tutorials for each below.\n\n1. Download and install an IDE\nDownload and install VScode.\nInstructions online e.g. here\nI’m using VScode because of its AI assistant integration. But you could also use positron if you have issues with VScode or want to use a Posit product rather than a Microsoft product.\n\n\n2. Get git and github\nInstall git on your computer. Optionally, get a github account and connect to that. Git does version control. Github lets you share that online. If your collaborators are github users then you can also share edits on documents this way.\nGit is also essential if you are using AI assistants. Sometimes they majorly stuff up your documents. So keeping back ups with git is essential.\n\n\n3. VScode extensions\nInstall these VScode extentions (or equivalents if you are using positron, note that many vscode extensions are also compatable with Positron)\n\nQuarto extension.\n\nOpen VSCode and click the four boxes ‘extension’ icon on the LHS then search and install the Quarto extension.\nOptional extensions: - R language extension (can be tricky to connect VScode to R, suggest you web search for advice)\n\n\n4. Optional steps for AI integration\nThis next step is optional. If you are using quarto or markdown its possible to get large-language models to help with many paper writing tasks (including the writing). This is a specialized area though and I’ve only given basic technical instructions here. Actually getting it to work well is another topic altogether and something I’m still developing…\nGet an API key with an LLM provider (e.g. OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic). You’ll need a developer account to get an API key, rather than a regular account that you may already have (see links in last sentence). Buy some credits so you can use your API.\nMake sure you save your API key somewhere safe! You can usually only view them once on creation. You’ll need it for the workshop.\nGet the Roo Code extension for vscode/positron.\nRead the documents/watch the tutorials and learn how to use Roo Code\nYou can now create a custom mode, e.g. a ‘scientific writing mode’ in Roo code. As of writing this requires clicking the mode selection button at the bottom of the Roo Code Pane, then click the Cog, then the + button to make a new mode. Then you need to write a ‘Role Definition’ and ‘Custom instructions’. For tools I just use ‘Read Files’, ‘Edit Files’ and unclick the others (will save you money and tokens).\nThis is the hard part that needs a lot of thought:\nIn the custom instructions you should write detailed instructions on how to help an author with scientific writing. For instance, you might want to put some very strong instructions about not making up references. You might also put instructions about your particular writing style preferences. I’m working on a template, but am not yet ready to share it.\nSee Roo code documentation for more advice on custom modes.\n\n\n5. Using quarto\nTake a tutorial and learn how to use Quarto.\nFor academic paper writing the key things to understand from the Quarto tutorial are:\n\nHow to knit as word or pdf (pdf requires extra software installations)\nFormatting, headings, bold etc…\nYAML frontmatter for styles, linking a bibliography and bibliography style\nHow to insert images and/or code.\n\nNote on AI integration once you are using quarto and Roo Code you can simply ask Roo Code to do things in your document (like outline a paper template) by referencing the file (e.g. @myfile.qmd) in the prompt box.\nWhether this works well for you is another questions. Prompting well requires a lot of thought and practice. Its not simply going to write a paper for you. You have to give the AI assistant detailed, specific, instructions and lots of context.\n\n\n6. YAML front matter\nThe YAML controls how your qmd document is rendered. Here’s an example of mine:\n---\ntitle: \"The paper's title\"\nformat: docx\neditor: visual\nbibliography: mybib.bib\ncsl: myjournal.csl\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  message: false\n  warning: false\n---\nThis goes at the top of your document. A few key points.\nformat controls document type to render this as, here a word doc.\neditor controls how it is viewed in vscode. Options are editor: visual and editor: source. Visual looks more like a word doc, source looks more like markdown. You’ll have to save and re-open the document for this to change.\nbibliography links to a bibtex file where your references are stored.\ncsl links to a style guide for the bibliography.\nMore on styles and references below.\nexecute is controlling how R code is run and if the R code appears in the document.\n\n\n7. Rendering as a document\nUse the short-cut key ‘cmd-shift-K’/‘cntrl-shft-k’ (mac/windows) to preview your document. It will also create a rendered version in your current directory.\nIts helpful to set: format: html when you are writing the document, then you get a live preview in vscode. Use format: docx when you want a word document.\nIts worth also learning the short-cut `cmd-shft-p’/‘cntrl-shft-p’, this brings up searchable actions for all extensions in vscode. The one you want is ‘Quarto: preview’ which does the same as the shortcut above.\nI tend to have minimal R code in my quarto manuscript. Or none at all (just reference .png files for figures). This keeps rendering quick. Also your document can get unweildy if there is a lot of text mixed in with R code.\n\n\n8. Word counts\nThere are various word count extensions for vscode qmd and md documents.\n\n\n9. Document styles\nGetting a word document to follow a particular style is a bit fiddly. You need to set-up a template word document with styles the include that as a reference in your YAML.\nSee instructions here.\n\n\n10. Reference manager integration\nQuarto integrates with many different reference managers. There’s a good guide here.\nIn brief you create a .bib file that has your references in it. This is then linked in the YAML. The manual way to manage this is just to create a .bib file and paste bibtext entries directly into it (available on most journal’s pages as a citation format, as well as google scholar).\ne.g. the bibtext for R looks like this:\n@Manual{Rlanguage,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2024},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\nThen in quarto you just type @ and a dropdown of all your references will appear. @Manual{Rlanguage, the Rlanguage bit is the CiteKey that will appear in the dropdown. So @Rlanguage will insert that reference into the bibliography and the citation at that place in the document.\nYou can streamline the process of gathering and managing references with a reference manager.\nMy workflow in Zotero is as follows:\n\nOpen Zotero on my computer\nGo to journal webpage for paper\nUse zotero plugin to my browser to grab the citation and save it to a library\nGo to my quarto document in VScode\ntype @ and a drop down of all references in all libraries on zotero appears. Pick the one I want.\nClick the OK button which saves that reference into my local .bib file.\n\nFor some reason (that does not seem to be documented in any quarto tutorials anywhere!) it will find any reference I have anywhere in zotero and then save that bibtex entry to my local .bib file, so it is now accessible for use in my quarto doc. This only works if I have zotero open and use editor: visual in the YAML.\nThere are many other options however.\n\n\n11. Optional AI integration for reference management\nYou can get AI assistants to help with referencing if you keep your notes on papers linked to your references. For instance, you could keep your notes on references in the bibtex field for notes. Alternatively you could create another quarto/markdown document that has a header for each citation tag along with its notes in a structured way:\n## Rlanguage \n\n### What it is\n\nThe R software for scientific computing. \n\n### Usage\n\nCitation for the R software. Use this at least once in every paper where i've used R for statistics\n\n## edgar2023continent\n\n### What is it\n\nKey paper that shows Australia is losing its marine biodiversity. \n\n### Usage\n\nCite this as evidence that Australia is losing coastal marine biodiversity and as evidence that climate change is causing marine biodiversity loss\n\nIt doesn’t matter how you do this, so long as you follow a consistent structure. I’ve used the CiteKey as the main header for each reference entry. Then I’ve put in markdown sections about each paper and why I might wnat to cite it. Then you can get Roo Code to help with inserting references.\nNote that if you are using the .bib directly just be careful not to plagiarise! Roo Code might insert excerpts from the abstracts/titles directly into your written document, which is a no-no for publishing."

    "text": "Many of us become scientists because we have witnessed the degradation of the environment and want to ‘make a difference’. I was therefore excited when the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) asked me for advice on developing a plan for managing the catchments and coral reefs of Vanua Levu, Fiji.\n\n\n\nLeft: Fish like this Giant Trevally prefer to hunt in clear water. Right: Streams draining forested catchments will carry clean water to the ocean.\n\n\nWCS is working with communities on island of Vanua Levu, to designate protected areas that will conserve local forests, protect clean water sources and avoid excessive runoff of soils and pollutants that may degrade coastal reefs.\nMy own career was inspired by growing up on an estuary where I couldn’t eat the local fish I caught, because of heavy metal pollution. The pollution was decades old, a result of decisions made by my parent’s and grandparent’s generations. I wanted to make sure my generation didn’t make the same mistakes.\nYet, the daily life of a university scientist often feels distant from any real change. Most early career researchers are so busy trying to chase funding and write ‘high-impact’ academic publications that they don’t have time to think about ‘real impact’ – science that helps people and ecosystems. The daily struggle to keep a job has often left me wondering if a career in science is really the most effective way to help the environment.\n\n\n\nFrom top: A Bauxite mine in Vanua Levu, the Bauxite is extracted from the top-soil. In the process much soil is released that flows into streams and out to the ocean. A river on Vanua Levu carrying sediment from mining and logging to the ocean. A reef smothered to death by sediment from on land.\n\n\nThe opportunity to advise on management plans for Fiji came through with a Science for Nature and People Partnership working group I have helped to lead (along with Carissa Klein and Hugh Possingham). These working groups are funded by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and The Nature Conservancy. They bring together scientists with the conservation staff who are working on the ground with environmental issues.\nMajor environmental issues and development pressures face the island of Vanua Levu. In particular, agriculture, logging, mining and road development cause soils and pollutants to run-off into streams where they can flow out to coral reef ecosystems. Run-off may be a major threat to coastal reefs and the local fisheries they support.\nThe hard work done by our WCS colleagues, particularly Sangeeta Mangubhai and Stacy Jupiter, to develop collaborations with communities and government on Vanua Levu meant our working group had a direct avenue to contribute toward environmental planning.\nWhen the Wildlife Conservation Society invited my colleague (Amelia Wenger from Uni of Queensland) and I to present our group’s science at a workshop with community and government leaders, I was both thrilled and daunted. Thrilled, because my science had a chance to inform environmental change. Daunted, because I had never visited Vanua Levu, but would be presenting to local people who live from the land and ocean resources I had studied remotely.\nMy own contribution before the workshop in Fiji was largely analytical. Our group brought together data from WCS to measure how land-use change has affected stream fish, coral reefs and coral reef fish (e.g. see this recent talk and paper). If I needed local advice on our work I could easily call up my WCS colleagues.\nTravelling to Nabouwalu a government centre on Vanua Levu where the workshop would be held, was something of a pilgrimage for me. On the way I finally got to see the ecosystems I had studied extensively on maps and satellite images. We flew over extensive reefs, pristine forest. We also saw the environmental damage the region will face more of in the future – Bauxite mining, logging, pine plantations, agriculture and murky rivers.\n\n\n\nDiscussing proposals for protected areas with local community members, WCS and Dr. Wenger from UQ.\n\n\nThe objective for the workshop was to bring together leaders from government departments representing these different industries and local leaders from different districts to build a spatial plan across the Bua Province (south-west portion of Vanua Levu). It is also an opportunity for communities to voice their concerns about environmental protection to central government.\nOur role was to present our work that showed the connections between land-use change and reef fish. In particular, we highlighted how actions in one district can affect the catchments and marine areas of neighbouring districts.\nAfter our initial presentations we had almost two days for community leaders and government members to discuss proposals for a new spatial plan.\nWe then developed the spatial and management plans with community members. The plans were designed through discussion around maps with marker pens. All my training in the sophisticated quantitative and computerised methods used spatial planning went out the window.\n\n\n\nClockwise from top-left: Fire threatens a pine plantation on Vanua Levu. A truck carries logs to a nearby sawmill. Farmland on Vanua Levu. Dr Wenger speaks at the workshop about balancing nature conservation with logging, farming and development.\n\n\nYou can run the computer programs for spatial planning interactively. However, in this case we had to ask the locals about where the pristine catchments were and where their drinking water came from. We also learned that one large catchment with intact forest on the south-coast had now been largely sold into logging concessions. Sadly, my earlier modelling had identified this very catchment as a major contributor to sedimentation to reefs if it was logged.\nDespite the technical simplicity of our approach, we did use many of the principles for conservation planning I had learned over the years. So science did underpin our advice.\nFor instance, we encouraged community members to identify and protect drinking water catchments – WCS has some evidence that typhoid outbreaks after cyclones are worsened in logged catchments.\nCommunity members also proposed a large ridge-line protected area that linked the land in between many of their districts. We encouraged them to identify at least one intact catchment per district for protection. That way the protected area might also protect connections among the regions ecosystems. For instance, Fiji’s unique fish species that migrate from the ocean to freshwater streams.\nOur discussions also emphasised the importance of riparian buffers and suitable road construction to avoid sediment run-off. These principles are already captured in Fiji’s forest practices act, but logging companies often disregard them. A key outcome from our workshop was identifying the need for paid forest wardens, who could ensure forest practices were followed.\n\n\n\nOne of Fiji’s iconic migratory fish (a goby) is represented on their $10 note.\n\n\nAt the end of the workshop I was exhausted but inspired to see our group’s science getting applied to a real planning process.\nWhether real change will happen in the region, we are yet to see. We discovered at this workshop that past protected areas that had been agreed to are now under logging concessions. At the end of the day, it will be WCS and the local people who will play the long-game in finding funding and community support for the new management plan.\n\n\n\nScenes from around Bua Province, Vanua Levu. Clockwise from left: coconut palms, Bua’s administrative centre, cleared land and forest adjacent to coral reefs.\n\n\nI was heartened though, by the closing speech from the local administrator. He said ‘we will not be the guilty generation.’ The Fijian people have lived sustainably in these catchments for generations. He was hoping that his generation could continue to coexist with nature into the future.\nNow, I am back in Fiji’s capital city and a brief encounter convinced me the Fijian people have the right mentality to protect their environment for future generations. Last night I was leaving a restaurant in the rain with a colleague and her baby. A group of burly men approached us in the dark car-park. “Baby Jack!” one of them greeted the baby warmly. The others swooned over him, tickling his toes to make him laugh.\nIn that moment, I saw a country bound by a sense of community and a people who clearly love the next generation. A desire to help the next generation, and the knowledge for how to do so should be all a community needs to make decisions that protect the future of their environment."

    "text": "How tools work\nThe basic example of a tool is getting the current date and time. Then when you ask for the time, instead of hallucinating a time and date, the model can use a tool to get an accurate current time and date.\nTools are defined using a Model Context Protocol, which is a standardized structure for connecting natural language models to programmatic tools (which have all the normal programming rules like being case-sensitive, syntax appropriate to the language etc).\nIts hard to find clear explanations of how they work, but here’s what I understand:\nThe tool is ‘registered’ with the model. This registering is just a prompt to the model, but it is done with a specific structure that defines the tool, its parameters, outputs and use cases. This way the model knows how to write code to run the tool.\nThen when you chat with the model it might interpret that tool use would be helpful. Like if you ask the time and it ‘knows’ about a time-date tool, it might use it. It writes the appropriate code to use the tool, sends that back to your computer (or to the API), where the code is evaluated. The output is then sent back to the model. The model interprets this into the final response it will give you.\nThere’s a good example of how tools don’t work and do work in the ellmer documentation.\nLet’s try a more interesting tool than the usual example of getting date and time."

    "text": "Defining the tool\nNow we know how to use remora to get the data, we can define a tool so the LLM can do it.\nWe’ll use the ellmer package to define the tool. First step is to make a function.\nThe ellmer documentation recommends you keep the function inputs and outputs simple. First of all, LLMs can’t handle complex R data structures (like complex lists). Second, the LLM will be consuming the inputs and outputs. This means it uses tokens, which cost you $ and use up the model’s context window (capacity for prompts).\nSo you don’t want to have gigabytes of data going into or out of the tool.\nTo get around this I’ve defined a tool that takes a path and write a file. That way the LLM doesn’t ‘see’ the data, it only sees the input and output paths and my depth request.\n#' Extracts SST data from the IMOS BlueLink database\n#'\n#' @param data_path A path to a csv dataframe\n#' @param depth The depth to extract the SST data from\n#' @return The current time in the given time zone.\nget_sst &lt;- function(data_path, depth) {\n  dat &lt;- read.csv(data_path)\n  datout &lt;- extractBlue(df = dat,\n                X = \"X\", \n                Y = \"Y\", \n                datetime = \"datetime\", \n                env_var = \"BRAN_temp\",\n                extract_depth = depth,\n                verbose = FALSE,\n                full_timeperiod = FALSE)\n  write.csv(datout, \"temp_data.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n  return(\"File written to sst_data.csv\")\n}\nNow just test the function works:\nget_sst(\"tas_dat.csv\", 30)\nThe ellmer package has a create_tool_def that semi-automates the next step based on the roxygen documentation I wrote above the function. However, this currently seems only to work if you have an openAI API key."

This means you can take any existing R function and easily turn it into a tool.\nYou do want to be careful about how much and the types of data that go into tools. There are obviously security concerns (what if the model created malicious code?) as well as privacy concerns if you are working with sensitive data.\nAPI costs could also blow up. ellmer provides a function token_usage(), to help you keep track of spending.\nOverall, I was excited at how easy it was to make a tool with interesting applications in my field of ocean sciences."

    "title": "modelbased package for plotting interactions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been a big fan of the visreg package for a while, it makes it convenient to plot predictions from models. But recently I was struggling with a model that had many two-way interactions terms.\nI checked out the key alternative to visreg, ggeffects, which is very popular (the paper has over 2000 citations). But the ggeffects page states it will be superseded by the modelbased package. So here’s a quick demo of how to use modelbased to plot interaction effects from a GLM.\nmodelbased is part of an ecosystem of packages for handling statistical models: easystats.\nFirst I’m going to load data on coral cover and fish abundance from my Example ecological data repo:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(easystats)\n\n# Attaching packages: easystats 0.7.5 (red = needs update)\n✔ bayestestR  0.17.0   ✔ correlation 0.8.8 \n✖ datawizard  1.2.0    ✔ effectsize  1.0.1 \n✔ insight     1.4.2    ✔ modelbased  0.13.0\n✖ performance 0.15.1   ✔ parameters  0.28.2\n✔ report      0.6.1    ✔ see         0.12.0\n\nRestart the R-Session and update packages with `easystats::easystats_update()`.\n\nlibrary(readr)\n# Load data from https://github.com/cbrown5/example-ecological-data\n\ndat_url &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbrown5/example-ecological-data/refs/heads/main/data/benthic-reefs-and-fish/fish-coral-cover-sites.csv\"\n\n#Convert counts of coral to proportions\ndat &lt;- read_csv(dat_url) %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        cb_cover = cb_cover / n_pts, \n        soft_cover = soft_cover / n_pts\n    ) \n\nRows: 49 Columns: 13\n\n\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (2): flow, logged\ndbl (11): site, reef.id, pres.topa, pres.habili, secchi, coordx, coordy, cb_...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nNow we’ll fit a simple poisson GLM. pres.topa is count of topa fish, a fish that likes to live in branching corals (cb_cover), and logged is a binary variable indicating whether the site was near to logging or not (which causes pollution that harms fish and corals).\n\nm1 &lt;- glm(pres.topa ~ cb_cover *  logged,\n          data = dat,\n          family = poisson)\nsummary(m1)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = pres.topa ~ cb_cover * logged, family = poisson, \n    data = dat)\n\nCoefficients:\n                          Estimate Std.

I’m going to do so on link scale (log scale for poisson models):\n\npr &lt;- estimate_means(m1, by = c(\"cb_cover\", \"logged\"),\n        estimate = \"typical\",\n        type = \"link\")\n\nplot(pr) +\n    labs(\n        x = \"Hard coral cover\",\n        y = \"Predicted Topa abundance (log scale)\",\n        color = \"Soft coral cover\", \n        fill = \"Soft coral cover\"\n    ) +  \n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne neat thing that modelbased does is give you different options for how to estimate marginal means. The default is “typical”, which estimates marginal means at the average value of numerical predictors and averages over frequencies of categorical predicotrs. But you can also do “average” which averages over sample distributions and “population” which attemps to create a counterfactual for all possible combinations of variables.\nThese answer different questions, see the documentation for more details.\nI’m going to make a dataframe of all three methods so we can compare them:\n\npr_typical &lt;- estimate_means(m1, by = \"cb_cover\",\n        estimate = \"typical\",\n        type = \"link\")\n\npr_average &lt;- estimate_means(m1, \n    by = list(cb_cover = unique(dat$cb_cover)),\n        estimate = \"average\",\n        type = \"link\")\n\npr_population &lt;- estimate_means(m1, by = c(\"cb_cover\"),\n        estimate = \"population\",\n        type = \"link\")\n\npr_all &lt;- bind_rows(\n    pr %&gt;% mutate(method = \"typical by logging\"),\n    pr_typical %&gt;% mutate(method = \"typical\"),\n    pr_average %&gt;% mutate(method = \"average\"),\n    pr_population %&gt;% mutate(method = \"population\")\n)\n\nNow we plot them:\n\nggplot(pr_all, aes(x = cb_cover, y = Mean, color = logged)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_linerange(aes(ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high)) +\n    facet_wrap(~method) +\n    labs(\n        x = \"Hard coral cover\",\n        y = \"Predicted Topa abundance (log scale)\",\n        color = \"Logged\"\n    ) +  \n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd one more plot just of population and typical to more easily see the diffence:\n\npd &lt;- position_dodge(width = 0.05)\npr_all %&gt;%\n    filter(method %in% c(\"population\", \"typical\")) %&gt;%\nggplot(., aes(x = cb_cover, y = Mean, color = method)) +\n    geom_point(position = pd) +\n    geom_linerange(aes(ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high), \n    position = pd) +\n    labs(\n        x = \"Hard coral cover\",\n        y = \"Predicted Topa abundance (log scale)\",\n        color = \"Logged\"\n    ) +  \n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see see some key differences. The typical method shows effects of hard coral cover for a typical observation. There are slightly more unlogged than logged sites in the data:\n\ntable(dat$logged)\n\n\n    Logged Not logged \n        21         28 \n\n\nSo the typical sample is different from a balanced population level average.\nThe population and typical predictions fall in between the predictions that are conditional on logging status, because both are kinds of averages over the two logging categories.\nPredictions from the ‘average’ method show an inconsistent pattern, because they are averaging over samples. You can roughly see the trends for logged and unlogged sites.\nFinally, let’s convince ourselves that the unbalanced data is causing these differences. I’m going to randomly remove some unlogged sites to create a balanced dataset, and refit the model:\n\n#randomly remove 7 'Not logged' sites to create balance\nset.seed(707)\nirm &lt;- sample(which(dat$logged == \"Not logged\"), 7)\ndat2 &lt;- dat[-irm, ]\n\nm2 &lt;- glm(pres.topa ~ cb_cover *  logged,\n          data = dat2,\n          family = poisson)\n\npr_typical2 &lt;- estimate_means(m2, by = \"cb_cover\",\n        estimate = \"typical\",\n        type = \"link\")\n\npr_population2 &lt;- estimate_means(m2, by = c(\"cb_cover\"),\n        estimate = \"population\",\n        type = \"link\")\n\npr_all2 &lt;- bind_rows(\n    pr_typical2 %&gt;% mutate(method = \"typical\"),\n    pr_population2 %&gt;% mutate(method = \"population\")\n)\n\npd &lt;- position_dodge(width = 0.02)\nggplot(pr_all2, aes(x = cb_cover, y = Mean, \n        color = method)) +\n    geom_point(position = pd) +\n    geom_linerange(aes(ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high),\n        position = pd) +\n    labs(\n        x = \"Hard coral cover\",\n        y = \"Predicted Topa abundance (log scale)\",\n        color = \"Logged\"\n    ) +  \n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the two types of predictions are identical with balanced data."

    "text": "22 Jun 2016\nI’m sitting here at the International Coral Reef Symposium in Hawaii. Looking at all the exciting graphs, data and analysis going up got me thinking: what are the key Rstats tools coral reef scientists should learn?\nStarting out with Rstats can be overwhelming because there are so many tools and packages available (but check out some of the free courses on my page). So here is a quick list of the key tools (packages and R functions) you should learn.\n\n\nA data visualisation tool tops the list. Data visualisation is the first step of analysis - you can quickly look for interesting patterns and check for errors. The ggplot2 (‘grammar of graphics 2’) package makes dataviz quick and easy. You can rapidly slice and dice your data in different ways for viz and also overplot simple analyses, like regressions rapidly. Check out the guide here.\n\n\n\nLinear models are becoming the dominant statistical tool for univariate data analysis in ecology and have largely replaced ANOVA methods. For instance, if you want to know how coral growth relates to temperature, how fish biomass relates to fishing pressure and so on you would probably use a linear model. Linear models are implemented in R with the function lm().\nA handy guide for analysis and interpretation of linear models has just been published and check out the books by the same author for guidance on how to code them up.\nA few quick examples on why lm() is so great. Just using a single continuous predictor - that is linear regression. Multiple continous predictor variables: multiple regression. If you combine categorical and continuous predictor variables you have your classic ANCOVA analysis. Use the predict() function to see what your trend lines look like. You can get confidence interval using the confint() functions. Do away with p-values they are dated 20th century statistics. Well ok p-values have their uses, but confidence intervals let you check how strong your effect is, as well as it’s significance.\n\n\n\nOnce you mastered lm(), glm() (generalized linear model) is a must for ecologists. We often deal with non-normal data (ie doesn’t fit a normal distribution), like presence/absence data and counts. lm() is inappropriate for this type of data. Way back in the 70s some clever people invented GLMs as a generalization of logistic regression. GLMs can handle many types of data. Check out Zuur et al.s book for a handy guide.\n\n\n\nEcological data is never simple and our data are often grouped. For instance, we often have blocks in experiments or transects within sites from field surveys. The package lme4 lets you implement random effects in linear models. Random effects are a flexible way to account for nuisance sources of variation, which may be important but we don’t have a specific hypothesis for which way the effect will go. Two key functions in lme4 are lmer() which is the random effects version of lm() and glmer(), the random effects version of glm(). Again, check out Zuur et al.s book for a handy guide.\n\n\n\nGot a large data-set? Need to merge data-sets by a common ID (e.g. site names)? Need to generate new variables from exisiting variables? Need to create data summaries? The package dplyr (‘data pliers’) is a must for all these tasks. Check out the vignette.\n\n\n\nOk, so you have entered your data (or got it from someone else), but wait a minute, the way you entered it doesn’t let you use ggplot2, dplyr, lm().. (if you followed my guide you shouldn’t have this problem). Do you need to reenter it? Nope, tidyr (for tidy data) to the rescue. The package tidyr lets you reformat data in ways (e.g. from wide format to long format) in the way that most stats packages prefer it. Check out this blog.\n\n\n\nThe package vegan provides good old multi-variate analysis, without the cost of Primer. Admittedly this package is slightly harder to use than Primer, but hey if you are already using R, the jump to primer is easy. Check out the vignettes to get started.\nThat’s my top 7. Good luck getting started."

    "title": "Adding desktop based work to your PhD? Here’s some things to think about",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The current pandemic is causing widespread disruptions to research, as travel, universities, labs and field stations shut-down. As a PhD student your timeline for submission of your thesis probably won’t be moved back because of the disruptions. Funding for scholarships still has the same limits as always. From what I’ve seen, universities are expecting students to adapt their work to the disruption and will not be putting forward blanket extensions to all PhDs.\nUnderstandably this situation creates a lot of anxiety.\nOne way to adapt your research is to replace field or lab work with desktop based research work. Whether this is appropriate for your PhD is a case-by-case decision and something you should discuss with your supervisor and mentors.\nA desktop based project might involve analysis of existing datasets, modelling or a literature review.\nIt seems like pursuing desktop based work is the advice university graduate schools and many supervisors will be giving their students. So thousands of researchers worldwide are about to embark on desktop based work, whether they have experience in this style of research or not.\nAs an ecosystem modelling, desktop based work is my bread and butter. So here’s a few things to think about if you are considering switching some of your field or lab research to modelling or data analysis.\n\n\nMany people underestimate how long it takes to develop models or data-analysis, just as I tend to under-estimate how complex field work will be. A story. Researchers in Australia wanted to watch fruit bats with a $7000 thermal camera. Sounds easy to me, just stick the camera up a tree. Problem is, coconut crabs might find the camera and rip it apart.\nThere are set backs in modelling too, that can be just as time consuming (though often less exciting). Like, the spatial data you want to process fills up your RAM, sending you on a 3 week journey looking for a suitable cloud-based processing service. Or the R package you’ve been using turns out to have a major bug.\nI commonly get asked to review or edit modelling papers. There are lots of common mistakes I see from groups not used to modelling. I could fill a whole blog with tips on that, but here’s a few major ones\n\nApplying an inappropriate modelling to the research question you want to answer. There are lots of models out there you can just download and start using. But models are usually developed for quite specific research questions, it may not be appropriate to use that same model for addressing different questions.\nBasic statistical mistakes, like treating psuedo-replicates as true replicates or mis-interpreting p-values.\nAbsence of sensitivity analysis, in the general sense (if you don’t know what that means, time to do some reading).\n\nThere’s a couple of things you can do to avoid these mistakes.\nFirst, get quantitative collaborators on board early and communicate with the regularly. Maybe your supervisor or lab group already has expertise in modelling, that is great, make use of it. Otherwise, you’ll have to put yourself out there and go looking (or ask your supervisor for help).\nCollaborators with expertise in the modelling you want to do will help you save time by avoiding common mistakes and help you find the right kind of methods for your research question.\nSecond, do your reading. Ecological modelling is a very large field with established norms for analysis. So read the literature in your area and find our what flies, what methods people commonly use.\nHere’s a few books I recommend my new ecology students read before starting modelling.\n\n\n\nGive yourself time to upskill. Take training appropriate to the type of modelling you want to do. And give yourself time in your PhD timeplan to do the training. It takes time to do modelling, and even more time if you are learning by doing.\nIn fact, if you are used to working on a well set-up study system, a modelling study may well take longer than doing the field or lab study. There is a lot of back and forwards between developing the model, finding suitable parameter settings, and updating your analysis.\nModelling studies are never really done, because you can always go back and tweak something and create different results. It takes time to get it right, longer than many people may think. (By right I mean results you can explain and make sense in terms of the ecology).\nSome good basic skills to have are of course in the R program, especially data wrangling skills and plotting skills (e.g. see my online notes for these things).\nThen, beyond that, the skills you will need depend a lot on the type of modelling you will do.\n(I’ll look to run some online training in the R program for marine scientists in the next few months. I was signed up for doing this anyway at 2 conferences, but now they are off! Stay tuned here for updates)\n\n\n\nYou may well be looking for data to analyse too. Good news is there is a lot of freely available data out there these days. But there are a few traps to avoid.\nThe biggest and best known datasets (e.g. like Landsat or the world database of protected areas) are very well analysed already. So it might be hard to find a novel question just using this data. This is also why it’s important to do your background reading. As they used to say, 30 minutes in the library can save weeks of fieldwork (or in this case modelling).\nCombining existing data together in new ways can be a good way to make something novel out of old data. So if you bring together landsat with some local data you have access too, you may well have a novel study.\nRemember that if you are using data, even if you’ve downloaded it ‘for free’ it is generally courteous to contact the data providers and let them know what you are doing.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The current pandemic is causing widespread disruptions to research, as travel, universities, labs and field stations shut-down. As a PhD student your timeline for submission of your thesis probably won’t be moved back because of the disruptions. Funding for scholarships still has the same limits as always. From what I’ve seen, universities are expecting students to adapt their work to the disruption and will not be putting forward blanket extensions to all PhDs.\nUnderstandably this situation creates a lot of anxiety.\nOne way to adapt your research is to replace field or lab work with desktop based research work. Whether this is appropriate for your PhD is a case-by-case decision and something you should discuss with your supervisor and mentors.\nA desktop based project might involve analysis of existing datasets, modelling or a literature review.\nIt seems like pursuing desktop based work is the advice university graduate schools and many supervisors will be giving their students. So thousands of researchers worldwide are about to embark on desktop based work, whether they have experience in this style of research or not.\nAs an ecosystem modelling, desktop based work is my bread and butter. So here’s a few things to think about if you are considering switching some of your field or lab research to modelling or data analysis.\n\n\nMany people underestimate how long it takes to develop models or data-analysis, just as I tend to under-estimate how complex field work will be. A story. Researchers in Australia wanted to watch fruit bats with a $7000 thermal camera. Sounds easy to me, just stick the camera up a tree. Problem is, coconut crabs might find the camera and rip it apart.\nThere are set backs in modelling too, that can be just as time consuming (though often less exciting). Like, the spatial data you want to process fills up your RAM, sending you on a 3 week journey looking for a suitable cloud-based processing service. Or the R package you’ve been using turns out to have a major bug.\nI commonly get asked to review or edit modelling papers. There are lots of common mistakes I see from groups not used to modelling. I could fill a whole blog with tips on that, but here’s a few major ones\n\nApplying an inappropriate modelling to the research question you want to answer. There are lots of models out there you can just download and start using. But models are usually developed for quite specific research questions, it may not be appropriate to use that same model for addressing different questions.\nBasic statistical mistakes, like treating psuedo-replicates as true replicates or mis-interpreting p-values.\nAbsence of sensitivity analysis, in the general sense (if you don’t know what that means, time to do some reading).\n\nThere’s a couple of things you can do to avoid these mistakes.\nFirst, get quantitative collaborators on board early and communicate with the regularly. Maybe your supervisor or lab group already has expertise in modelling, that is great, make use of it. Otherwise, you’ll have to put yourself out there and go looking (or ask your supervisor for help).\nCollaborators with expertise in the modelling you want to do will help you save time by avoiding common mistakes and help you find the right kind of methods for your research question.\nSecond, do your reading. Ecological modelling is a very large field with established norms for analysis. So read the literature in your area and find our what flies, what methods people commonly use.\nHere’s a few books I recommend my new ecology students read before starting modelling.\n\n\n\nGive yourself time to upskill. Take training appropriate to the type of modelling you want to do. And give yourself time in your PhD timeplan to do the training. It takes time to do modelling, and even more time if you are learning by doing.\nIn fact, if you are used to working on a well set-up study system, a modelling study may well take longer than doing the field or lab study. There is a lot of back and forwards between developing the model, finding suitable parameter settings, and updating your analysis.\nModelling studies are never really done, because you can always go back and tweak something and create different results. It takes time to get it right, longer than many people may think. (By right I mean results you can explain and make sense in terms of the ecology).\nSome good basic skills to have are of course in the R program, especially data wrangling skills and plotting skills (e.g. see my online notes for these things).\nThen, beyond that, the skills you will need depend a lot on the type of modelling you will do.\n(I’ll look to run some online training in the R program for marine scientists in the next few months. I was signed up for doing this anyway at 2 conferences, but now they are off! Stay tuned here for updates)\n\n\n\nYou may well be looking for data to analyse too. Good news is there is a lot of freely available data out there these days. But there are a few traps to avoid.\nThe biggest and best known datasets (e.g. like Landsat or the world database of protected areas) are very well analysed already. So it might be hard to find a novel question just using this data. This is also why it’s important to do your background reading. As they used to say, 30 minutes in the library can save weeks of fieldwork (or in this case modelling).\nCombining existing data together in new ways can be a good way to make something novel out of old data. So if you bring together landsat with some local data you have access too, you may well have a novel study.\nRemember that if you are using data, even if you’ve downloaded it ‘for free’ it is generally courteous to contact the data providers and let them know what you are doing. Obviously, you don’t need to ask to use landsat data (but do read the data license). But, say you want to use data published with a study, you should write the authors and tell them what you are doing. They may already be working on that analysis, so this simple step is both polite and will save you time.\nOtlet, a data sharing service, are offering a ‘match-making’ service to help students and postdocs find data. Thanks Gretta Pecl for sharing this tip.\n\n\n\nIf you are a field or lab ecologists about to embark on a modelling study, you have some unique strengths to bring to a modelling study.\nYou probably have a different perspective than most full-time modellers.

    "title": "Using R and power analysis to inform experimental design",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A collaborator once asked me: “can you do that thing where you take a little bit of data and model it up to make lots more data?”\nDoes it sound suspicious to fake a lot of data from a little bit of data? It depends on the context. Making up data is totally appropriate if you want to do a power analysis.\nAnd ‘making-up’ data (let’s call it simulation from now on) for power analysis is a handy tactic for designing effective surveys and experiments. This post will look at why and how.\n\n\nIn the narrow-sense, power analysis it about type II error, or the chance your data and analysis won’t be able to detect an effect that is really there.\nType II errors are the quiet sibling to type I errors, which tend to get more focus. The whole “&lt;0.05 is significant”” mentality is about type I errors.\nHaving a low type I is important if you want to say a new drug, which may have side-effects, works.\nBut in many fields, type II errors are more consequential. In environmental science in particular, we don’t want significant (in the non-statistical sense of the word) environmental change to go unnoticed. Poor power would mean we are unlikely to detect environmental change in our acidification experiments, or from say an oil spill decimating a seabird colony.\nPragmatically, if you are doing a PhD you have a limited amount of time to get publishable results. So you’d want enough power to detect an effect, should it be there.\nPower analysis is also much more useful type II errors, when used in the broader sense of the term.\nBroad-sense power analysis is about how well data and a statistical model work together to measure an effect. So it could be about whether we measure the right effect (not just whether we measure it at all).\nIn the broad and narrow sense, power analysis is a really helpful tool when you are designing experiments, or a field survey.\nFor more on traditional power analysis in environmental stats I recommend the textbook Quinn and Keough (or google it to find a pdf) or in the broad-sense Bolker’s excellent book\n\n\n\nLet’s say you want to know whether there are more fish inside a marine reserve (that have no fishing) than outside the reserve. You are going to do a number of standardized transects inside and outside the reserve and count the numbers of fish.\nYour fish species of interest are a very abundant sweetlips and a rather rare humphead wrasse. What’s the chance that you would be able to detect a two times difference in abundance for each fish species between reserves and fished areas?\nWe can address this question with power analysis by simulating ‘fake’ data for the surveys where there is a doubling of abundance, then fitting a statistical model to the fake data, then deciding whether or not the difference is ‘significant’ (e.g. p&lt;0.05). Then we repeat that a 1000 times and count up the % of times we said there was a difference. That % is the power.\nSo we need to decide on a few things ahead of time, the sample size of surveys, the expected (mean) abundance values and the variance in abundance. This is where you could draw on earlier literature to make estimated guesses. The sample size is up for grabs and trying different sample sizes could be part of your power analysis.\nLet’s assume there are normally 10 sweetlips per transect and 1 humphead wrasse per transect.\nAs the data are counts we’ll assume they are Poisson distributed. This amounts to assuming mean = variance, so the variance of sweetlips across transects is 10 and wrasse is 1.\n\n\n\nTo answer this question with R we are going to use quite a few handy packages:\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\npurrr is handing for creating 1000s of randomised datasets, ggplot2 is for plots, broom is for cleaning the 1000s of models we’ll fit, dplyr and tidyr are for data wrangling.\nNow let’s create a function that simulates data and fits a model. This may look overwhelming, but don’t worry about the R details if you’re not that into R. All we are doing is creating a function that simultions some data from two groups (reserve or not) for n transects, and then fits a GLM and finally it spits out a p-value for whether there was a significant difference in the simulated data.\nsim &lt;- function(n, x1, x2){\n  x &lt;- rep(c(x1, x2), each = n/2)\n  y &lt;- rpois(n, lambda = x)\n  m1 &lt;- glm(y ~ x, family = \"poisson\") %&gt;% tidy()\n  m1\n}\nNow we can use our simulation function to simulate counting wrasse on 20 transects (10 inside and 10 outside the reserve), and then fitting the GLM to that data:\nset.seed(2001) #just do this to get the same result as me\nsim(100, 1, 2)\n\n## # A tibble: 2 x 5\n##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 (Intercept)   -0.522     0.287     -1.82 0.0690  \n## 2 x              0.618     0.167      3.69 0.000222\nSo we get a table with mean estimated difference (on log scale), standard errors and p-values.\n\n\n\nNow we use purrr to do this 1000 times:\nmout &lt;- map(1:1000, ~sim(20, 1, 2))\nWhich results in 1000 lists, yuck. Let’s do some data wrangling on the output:\n mout2 &lt;- mout %&gt;%\n  bind_rows(.id = \"rep\") %&gt;%\n  filter(term != \"(Intercept)\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Signif = p.value &lt; 0.05,\n         rep = as.numeric(rep))\nhead(data.frame(mout2))\n\n##   rep term      estimate std.error     statistic     p.value Signif\n## 1   1    x  6.931472e-01 0.4082471  1.697862e+00 0.089533876  FALSE\n## 2   2    x  8.266786e-01 0.4531632  1.824240e+00 0.068115744  FALSE\n## 3   3    x  5.877867e-01 0.3220304  1.825252e+00 0.067963001  FALSE\n## 4   4    x  1.145132e+00 0.4339488  2.638865e+00 0.008318414   TRUE\n## 5   5    x  1.823216e-01 0.3496022  5.215114e-01 0.602010565  FALSE\n## 6   6    x -2.823275e-13 0.3429971 -8.231194e-13 1.000000000  FALSE\nNow we get a dataframe of the 1000 simulations, indicating whether p for the difference between reserve vs unreserved was &lt;0.05 (column ‘Signif’).\nTo get the power, we just sum Signif and divide by the 1000 trials:\nsum(mout2$Signif)/1000\n\n## [1] 0.408\nSo an ~40% chance we’d detect a 2x difference in wrasse abundance with 20 transects. This is the 2-sided probability, arguably for this question we could also use a one-sided test.\nTry it again for the sweetlips (expected abundance doubling from 10 to 20). You’ll see you get much more power with this more abundance species (almost 100%).\nYou could try this with different sample sizes to get an idea of how much effort you need to invest in doing transects in order to see a difference (if the difference is really there of course).\n\n\n\nHow close does our approach get us to the 2x difference? We can also answer that by looking at the estimates from the GLM:\nggplot(mout2, aes(x = exp(estimate))) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"tomato\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2) +\n  xlab(\"Estimated times difference\")\n\nThis distribution shows the expected outcomes we’d estimate over 1000 repeats of the surveys. So the solid vertical line is the ‘real’ difference. Note the long tail to the left of drastic overestimates. It is common with small sample sizes that we might overestimate the true effect size. More on this later.\nI took the exponent of the estimate (estimated mean difference), because the Poisson GLM has a log link, so the estimate is on the log scale. Taking its exponent means it is now interpreted as a times difference (as per the x-axis label).\n\n\n\nIt is reasonably well known that over-use of p-values can contribute to publication bias, where scientists tend to publish papers about significant and possibly overestimated effect sizes, but never publish the non-significant results. This bias can be particularly bad with small sample sizes, because there’s a reasonable chance we’ll see a big difference and therefore, make a big deal about it.\nWe can look at this phenomena in our simulations. First, let’s take the mean of our estimated effect sizes for those trials that were significant and those that were not:\nsignif_mean &lt;- mean(exp(filter(mout2, Signif)$estimate))\nnonsignif_mean &lt;- mean(exp(filter(mout2, !Signif)$estimate))\nall_mean &lt;- mean(exp(mout2$estimate))\nc(all_mean, signif_mean, nonsignif_mean)\n\n## [1] 2.210280 3.062810 1.622725\nSo average effect size for the significant trials is &gt;3x (remember the real difference is 2x). If we take the average across all trials it is closer to the truth (2.3x).\nClearly if we only publish the significant results, over many studies this will add up to a much bigger difference than is really there. This can be a problem in some fields. I don’t think publication bias particularly affects studies of marine reserves, because typically there are multiple research questions, so the researchers will publish anyway.\nLet’s look at this as a plot. We’ll do the same distribution as above, but with different colours for significant versus non-significant.\nggplot(mout2, aes(x = exp(estimate), fill = Signif)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2) +\n  xlab(\"Estimated times difference\") +\n  xlim(0,5)\n\nYou can clearly see the significant trials almost always overestimate the true difference (vertical line).\nWhat’s the solution? Make sure you report on non-significant results. And try to aim for larger sample sizes."

    "text": "It is reasonably well known that over-use of p-values can contribute to publication bias, where scientists tend to publish papers about significant and possibly overestimated effect sizes, but never publish the non-significant results. This bias can be particularly bad with small sample sizes, because there’s a reasonable chance we’ll see a big difference and therefore, make a big deal about it.\nWe can look at this phenomena in our simulations. First, let’s take the mean of our estimated effect sizes for those trials that were significant and those that were not:\nsignif_mean &lt;- mean(exp(filter(mout2, Signif)$estimate))\nnonsignif_mean &lt;- mean(exp(filter(mout2, !Signif)$estimate))\nall_mean &lt;- mean(exp(mout2$estimate))\nc(all_mean, signif_mean, nonsignif_mean)\n\n## [1] 2.210280 3.062810 1.622725\nSo average effect size for the significant trials is &gt;3x (remember the real difference is 2x). If we take the average across all trials it is closer to the truth (2.3x).\nClearly if we only publish the significant results, over many studies this will add up to a much bigger difference than is really there. This can be a problem in some fields. I don’t think publication bias particularly affects studies of marine reserves, because typically there are multiple research questions, so the researchers will publish anyway.\nLet’s look at this as a plot. We’ll do the same distribution as above, but with different colours for significant versus non-significant.\nggplot(mout2, aes(x = exp(estimate), fill = Signif)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2) +\n  xlab(\"Estimated times difference\") +\n  xlim(0,5)\n\nYou can clearly see the significant trials almost always overestimate the true difference (vertical line).\nWhat’s the solution? Make sure you report on non-significant results. And try to aim for larger sample sizes."

But coastal restoration is risky in a rapidly changing climate.\nIn our new project we will be working with the World Wildlife Fund (US Oceans team) to look at climate smart restoration and protection of mangroves. The project “Global Prioritization of Mangrove Conservation and Restoration incorporating future Climate Change Impacts” is lead by Associate Professor Chris Brown (The Global Wetlands Project) and Dr Dominic Andradi-Brown (WWF-US).\nInvestment in mangrove conservation actions is rapidly scaling-up, so we need to make sure these well intentioned efforts aren’t undone by the future impacts of climate change. Two climate impacts of particular importance on the coast are sea level rise and storms. Sea levels are rising with global warming and these rises will accelerate into the future. Tropical storms can damage or wipe out mangrove forests. Trends for storms are variable, but overall the frequency of severe storms is expected to increase in the future.\nOur project has two parts. The first part will be lead by Dr Christina Buelow, a coastal ecosystem modeller from The Global Wetlands Project.\nDr Buelow will integrate climate models with models of mangrove forest change to predict locations globally that are most likely to be affected by climate impacts. We will then use this information to identify areas that are low risk for mangrove conservation and areas where additional adaptation measures will be needed (such as planned retreat or modifying the species composition of restoration actions).\nThe second part focuses on local-scale action and is led by socio-ecological scientist Dr Jaramar Villareal-Rosas. She will lead work that supports WWF offices across the globe to implement climate smart conservation plans for mangroves. This will include adapting restoration techniques so that restored habitat is more resilient to climate change, and helping teams identify sites that are resilient to climate change.\nOverall this project aims to advance our ability to plan mangrove conservation for climate change, at local and global scales.\nThe Global Wetlands Project team on the project includes: Associate Professor Chris Brown (Lead), Dr Christina Buelow, Dr Jaramar Villareal-Rosas, Professor Rod Connolly, Dr Mischa Turschwell and Dr Fernanda Adame."

    "text": "What social media has that much online teaching lacks is its highly engaging while being cheap to produce.\nI like my undergraduate teaching and I’m always trying to improve at that. I’m also interested in social media and have dabbled in text, image and video based social media.\nThis got me thinking: the approach to creating social media has many advantages that could be applied to creating content university undergraduate degrees. I’m thinking particularly for online content.\nUniversity education has increasingly moved online, especially since covid. Currently what we see in many places is just the same old lectures delived through video or provided as recordings. I’m the first to admit that these are often dead boring to watch, and I’ve recorded many of these myself.\nIts just hard to find the motivation to sit down and watch 50 minutes of powerpoint slides, especially if you have the freedom to watch it whenever you want (meaning you’ll always find something more interesting to do instead).\nSo one solution is to work with digital specialists to create engaging online content. This could be games or interactive platforms where the user explores a landscape.\nThat’s great when you have the resources, but its expensive (lots of staff time) to create content like that. Staff time is one of the main constraints on the quality of university teaching. Staff only have time to create so much content when there’s so much else to do with administering courses, running assessments and so on.\nSo how can we create lots of engaging online content quickly, easily and cheapily?\nSocial media is designed to make cheap content engaging, indeed often highly addictive.\nI often find myself on youtube for much longer than 50 minutes, without even intending too.\nHow that happens is I start watching one short video “its only five minutes”, that then leads me to another video and so on.\nAnd each of these videos is done on the cheap, often only with a phone camera and perhaps a microphone or gopro.\nWhat the content creaters always have is a great story and engaging presentation skills (whether that’s with video, writing text or taking photos).\nContent creation is a skill that can be learned with practice. For instance, when I started doing youtube I realised I looked super grumpy on video. So I practiced smiling more for video and straightaway my content became more engaging.\nCreating a good video (or thread or blog) does require a bit of planning. Key is to think about the story. This is a change from the usual style of a university lecturer, which is to just explain facts straight-up.\nThe facts are more easily digested if they are weaved into a story. A bonus is that the viewer is also more likely to remember them if they are told as a story. Our brains are wired for stories, not sequencese of facts.\nEspecially not sequences of facts that go for 50 minutes.\nSo here’s my vision. We give lecturers decent cameras (or phones) and microphones. We give them some basic training in using the gear, and also some training in storytelling. Then we send them out to create content.\nSome of this content will be carefully planned for class. Other content can be recorded on the fly when they are doing their research.\nImagine a marine scientist lecturer is out on a field trip when they see birds diving into the sea to catch fish. They just grab some video of the action, and then quickly record themselves talking about predation in the ocean. It helps that they are super excited, because they are on the scene of predation in action.\nOr imagine the lecturer is at a conference and meets the person who wrote the seminal paper the class will be studying. They grab a quick interview and get the cool story behind the research on how the researcher risked a bear attack to collect the data.\nAll this videos are short. 7 minutes or even shorter is ideal, because that is what people are happy to watch. The lecturer weaves the series of videos into a lesson. The catch is, once you start the first 7 minutes its good enough that students are happy to roll onto the next one and the next one. Before they know it your student has consumed 50 minutes ‘lectures’.\nWhen I get the time I’ll make an example of a social media style lecture and post it to my youtube channel\nYou may same this will all take more time than just doing a powerpoint. But you’d be surprised how quick you can make videos once you get an eye for good content.\nI can tell you, making the videos is a whole lot more fun too."

    "title": "How will heatwaves and coral loss affect reef fisheries?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There has been a lot of focus on the challenge of managing overfishing with the controversial new documentary Seaspiracy on Netflix. But the overfishing issue isn’t as simple an issue as the picture that documentary paints.\nThe sustainability of coral reef fisheries around the world is threatened by too much fishing, but also by extensive change in reef habitats.\nNotably, heatwaves are becoming more intense and frequent under climate change and are now a main driver of coral loss. But how will heatwaves and coral loss impact the sustainability of reef fisheries? This is a question we have been working on over the past few years.\nPlease contact me (chris.brown@griffith.edu.au) if you can’t access the full-text versions of the work below (some but not all are open access).\nOverfishing is the main human-driven cause of stock declines, but we shouldn’t focus solely on that issue. A significant proportion of fish stocks at a global scale are dependent on habitats that have been degraded over recent decades, like corals.\nBut, it is hard to pin fishery declines on habitat loss, because the mechanisms for habitat loss to impact fisheries are complex. We found that habitat loss interacts with fishery management in surprising ways.\nHabitat loss can contribute to overfishing because it reduces the productivity of fisheries. But, if those declines in productivity are detected by monitoring and wrongly attributed to overfishing, the management response could actually make management more conservative, as we described in our review of how habitat loss impacts fisheries.\n\n\n\nsweetlips on a reef\n\n\nHabitat loss likely threatens many of the world’s coral reef fisheries. An unprecedented heatwave in 2016 affected reefs globally, and on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef caused extensive mortality of corals. We studied this event to see how it may impact reef fisheries.\nWe reviewed Queensland’s fisheries for the effects of coral loss on key fishery species. There was marked regional variation within Queensland in the dependence of fisheries on reef species. This variation corresponded to the types of fisheries dominating particular regions.\nAquarium collection fisheries (including fish, corals and other invertebrates) and the reef line fishery are the most likely to be affected by coral habitat loss. Importantly, quantitative stock analysis identified several reef snapper (Lutjanidae) species that are at risk of overfishing due to the interaction of fishing pressures and coral habitat declines.\nHabitat loss is not the only pathway for heatwaves to impact reef fisheries. Heatwaves also have direct effects on fish.\nThere was extensive coral mortality, but most fish species did not respond to this habitat loss in the short-term. Rather, there was a direct effect of the warming on the fish community, such that there were species declines in the northern warm waters and increases in species richness on some southern reefs. These changes are consistent with range shifts in the fish community.\n\n\n\neffects of heatwaves on coral trout\n\n\nIf heatwaves have direct physiological effects on fish communities, they may also how easily fish can be caught in fisheries. We addressed this question for coral trout, the most important commercial finfish taxa on the Great Barrier Reef.\nWe used a unique dataset of reef fish surveys, collected by citizen scientists working with the Reef Life Survey not-for-profit. We matched that data to fish catch data. This enabled us to look at how fish populations and fish catch changed over the heatwave.\nWe found modest evidence for a southward shift in coral trout after the heatwave. More important though was that we found coral trout were easier to catch when it is warmer. We predicted the heatwave raised catches by as much as 18%, given the for the amount of fishing effort in the heatwave year.\nWe hypothesised that coral trout got easier to catch during the heatwave because they were hungrier. Coral trout eat more when it’s warmer, to keep up with their metabolic demands. The line fishery uses baited lines and lures, so coral trout may have been more attracted to bait when temperatures were raised.\nIf fish get easier to catch then the risk of overfishing them could also be higher. The current management regime for the Great Barrier Reef fishery is based on a total allowable catch. If this system is adhered to, it should prevent overfishing of coral trout, even if they are easier to catch in the future. In many other coral reef fisheries around the world though there are no limits on catch. In such places overfishing will be a greater risk under recurrent heatwaves.\nOverall this body of work has identified multiple ways that heatwaves impact reef fisheries. Importantly habitat loss and the direct effects of warming will both impact fish species, but the sustainability of the fishery also depends on how it is managed. This finding provides hope that proactive fishery management can maintain sustainable fisheries in the face of climate change.\nThe work discussed in this article was supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Award to Chris Brown"

    "text": "This tip is great for a quick non-linear test, before you go all the way with a GAM or parametric non-linear model.\nYou’ll need the splines library, which comes shipped with R anyway.\nFirst, let’s make up a bit of count data. The underlying ‘true’ model will be poisson (think count data) with a log link (so slope estimates are multiplicative of the poisson mean). But we’ll introduce a bit of non-linearity.\nn &lt;- 100\nset.seed(101)\nx &lt;- sort(rnorm(n, sd = 2))\nmu &lt;- 2 + 0.1*x - 0.6*x^2 + 0.18*x^3#linear predictor\n\ny &lt;- rpois(n, exp(mu))\nplot(x, y)\nlines(x, exp(mu))\n\nNow, we could just fit a polynomial, but for real data we wouldn’t know the mean structure was generated as a polynomial. So we might want to use something a bit more flexible, like a cubic spline.\nSo, here’s how to make a cubic spline. We just need to choose the degrees of freedom. A DF of of 1 will give us a linear fit, higher DFs allow more bends (‘knots’). We’ll fit a log-linear model, a model with df = 2 and a model with df= 3 Given we generated our data with a cubic polynomial, we’d expect the 3 df model will do best\nlibrary(splines)\n#log linear model\nm1 &lt;- glm(y ~ x, family = \"poisson\")\nm1pred &lt;- predict(m1, type = \"response\")\n\n#non-linear models\nm2 &lt;- glm(y ~ ns(x,2), family = \"poisson\")\nm2pred &lt;- predict(m2, type = \"response\")\n\nm3 &lt;- glm(y ~ ns(x,3), family = \"poisson\")\nm3pred &lt;- predict(m3, type = \"response\")\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,3))\nplot(x, y, main = \"DF = 1\")\nlines(x, exp(mu), lwd = 2, col = \"grey\")\nlines(x, m1pred, col = \"orange\", lwd = 2)\n\nplot(x, y, main = \"DF = 2\")\nlines(x, exp(mu), lwd = 2, col = \"grey\")\nlines(x, m2pred, col = \"purple\", lwd = 2)\n\nplot(x, y, main = \"DF = 3\")\nlines(x, exp(mu), lwd = 2, col = \"grey\")\nlines(x, m3pred, col = \"darkblue\", lwd = 2)\n The orange line is the naive linear fit, it basically shows no trend. The purple line (df = 2) does better, but misses the kick up at the end. The blue line looks closest to the ‘true’ mean function (grey line).\nThe purple and blue lines are our spline fits with 1 and 2 knots respectively. Both clearly capture the non-linearity. The grey line is the ‘true’ mean structure we created above. So our splines just peaks a bit too hard, but does get the shape right.\nWe can convince ourselves that the 3 df splines model is better with AIC\nAIC(m1)\n\n## [1] 492.1094\n\nAIC(m2)\n\n## [1] 434.6807\n\nAIC(m3)\n\n## [1] 362.3653\nYep, the 3 spline model has a much lower AIC despite using more model D.F., so is better.\n\n\nA nice feature of this cubic spline trick is that you can use it anywhere that takes a model matrix as input. So it will work with glm, glmer, lmer and any Bayesian GLM method you care to use. Just apply your normal model selection criteria to find the ‘best’ number of knots.\nFirst, set the knots using x:\nlibrary(splines)\nxcs &lt;- ns(x, 3) #3 knots!\nhead(xcs, 3)\n\n##                1         2           3\n## [1,]  0.00000000 0.0000000  0.00000000\n## [2,] -0.04388799 0.1157184 -0.07117461\n## [3,] -0.04775128 0.1262731 -0.07766646\n\nplot(x, xcs[,1], type = 'l', ylim = c(min(xcs), max(xcs)))\nlines(x, xcs[,2], col = \"salmon\")\nlines(x, xcs[,3], col = \"steelblue\")\n\nThis splits x into three covariates (note the new matrix xcs has three columns), which I’ve plotted above. The cubic spline algorithm puts bends in the new covariates according to the density of the data.\nWe can use these new covariates in our model and glm will estimate a coefficient for each one.\nBecause the xcs are a non-linear functions of x, fitting a model against them means we can mix the curves to get a non-linear fit. We do lose a few degrees of freedom though, because now x is three covariates, instead of just one.\nWe can just use xcs in our model formula as a covariate.\nBut I prefer just to put the ns command directly into the model formula, that way it is easy to change the knots, as we did above.\n\n\n\nIf you really want to get into non-linear trend fitting, you should use a generalized additive model (GAM), such as from package mgcv.\nIn fact, GAM can fit these kind of splines for you too (and more), it just uses a different method to select the number of knots.\nBut the splines trick is still handy. For instance, you can quickly modify an existing linear model to have a non-linear spline. Or use it in a Bayesian linear model that doesn’t have a GAM equivalent (you can also spit out model matrices from mgcv and use them in Bayesian models if you want other types of splines).\nSo I hope you enjoying splining."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When we think of coaching we usually think of someone more experienced, like a supervisor, coaching someone less experienced, like their junior staff or students. But staff and students can also coach upwards to their supervisor as well.\nFirst a word on coaching, managing and mentoring. Mentoring is typically showing someone a path that you have trodden yourself. So you are teaching someone something you know well how to do. Whereas, coaching is about developing the person’s skills and helping them find direction in their career. So you can coach someone without having any expertise in their subject area.\nPeople sometimes talk about ‘managing up’. Managing up differs from coaching up. Managing up is task focused. One example of managing up would be communicating to your supervisor clear expectations about when you can complete a task, like “I’m on holidays for the next two weeks, so you won’t get the next draft until the end of November”.\nCoaching up is person focused. Whether you know it or not, there is a lot that you can teach you supervisor. The beauty of coaching is that you don’t have to know the answers in advance.\nHere’s some examples.\nFirst, you can think about their role and perspective, rather than your own. Say they have been consistently late on returning feedback on drafts and you are feeling frustrated by that. Before you tell them about your frustration, ask questions to learn why they are consistently late. For instance you could ask “What’s been holding most of your attention at work recently?” Maybe they have a major grant deadline approaching, are overloaded with teaching or have challenges in their personal life.\nOnce you understand why they are late, and that it may not be their fault, you are in a better position to collaborate with them on solutions to getting feedback on your work.\nAnother example is if you have negative feedback for them. Let’s say your supervisor was very aggressive in questioning another student at the student’s seminar and you noticed the student was upset afterwards.\nIt might be tempting to tell the supervisor straight-up that they were being mean, or avoid the confrontation and not say anything at all. But you can sidestep the confrontation while still giving them the feedback by coaching them through to finding a better approach.\nYou can ask them questions like, “how do you think the student felt after presenting their seminar?” or “did you notice any changes in the student’s behaviour after their seminar?”\nYou could then follow up with revealing the information you have, that the student seemed very upset by the questions.\nYou can give positive feedback on their supervision as well. My students and staff are great at this, but I understand it’s not common. For example, I was coaching one staff member on the decision to invest effort into applying for a grant. I was asking them if having the grant was aligned with where they saw their career, and work-life balance, in the future.\nThe staff member followed up later to tell me how beneficial that discussion had been, and that it had helped them think about this decision in a new way. Now they are coaching me, by providing me with positive reinforcement on the approach to supervision I was trying in our earlier discussion.\nOne final example. When I meet with senior staff I often ask them how they feel about certain events. I’m just curious to know what they make of it. I might ask about a positive thing, like a if they enjoyed the seminar from a visiting prof. Or something that might be troubling them, like a how they feel about a change in the priorities of their major funder.\nGiving people space to talk about how events have impacted their emotions is part of coaching, and senior staff often aren’t given that space.\nIf you are a supervisor you can encourage coaching up by creating an environment where sharing feelings and positive feedback are welcomed. Modelling coaching in your interactions with staff and students will also help them learn the skill.\nFinally, coaching takes time so be patient. It’s a long-term game, but in my experience I’ve see the biggest changes in people’s approaches to work through coaching.\nJust want to say a huge thanks to my coaches. Especially Chris Reilly and Mary Saunders, who teach an amazing course on Manager as Coach at Griffith University. Also huge thanks to my staff and students, many of whom excel at coaching up. Thanks to their insightful questions, I often leave our meetings rethinking how I will approach being a supervisor."

These nutrients have remarkable effects on stream-side ecosystems, like increasing [plant diversity]](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6024/1609?casa_token=SbM0_-Wr3WIAAAAA:k9ajEC6j5fa5EdyYDDI2Hn7tpkR5RgV3j4tiSi7bYhidXBi13kd6P87WGkC_HFZzh8Bwn_T3nPNJ__M), raising bird diversity and increasing tree growth.\nWe wanted to know if all this fertilization of local vegetation showed up in satellite images.

This connection may be weakened if fisheries catch too many salmon. Salmon populations in many places are also threatened by development and mining in their catchments.\nIt may seem odd for an Australian researcher to work on northern salmon, but this work was facilitated by a trans-Pacific connection. Griffith has a kind of sister-school relationship with Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.\nI won a travel grant from Griffith to visit Simon Fraser University. On my travels I heard about the remarkable work that John Reynolds and his team are doing on documenting how salmon bring nutrients to streamside ecosystems. I started wondering if such effects would show up in satellite images.\nWe decided to look at the ‘greenness’ of satellite image. Greenness is a common indicator of vegetation productivity that reflects chlorophyll density in leaves. Chlorophyll is the pigment that helps plants turn sunlight into energy.\nWe studied two different places. In central British Columbia John and his team have detailed surveys of 50 salmon spawning streams. We compared greenness across these sites and found trees were greener near streams with higher salmon spawning densities.\nWe also compared greenness across different years on the lower Fraser river in southern British Columbia. Salmon spawning numbers in the lower Fraser are dominated by pink salmon, which tend to only return in odd numbered years to spawn. So we expected an ‘on-off’ pattern in greenness.\nIn the lower Fraser we found such an ‘on-off’ pattern.\nSo we’d like to use this technique to measure the footprint of salmon across all spawning streams. However, the science isn’t quite there yet.\nAt both sites the salmon signal was well hidden under other drivers of greenness. For example, at the central coast site in particular, alders, a type of tree that can make its own nutrients, weakened the effect of salmon on greenness. At the lower Fraser site, patterns of greenness were dominated by the weather first, with salmon fertilization playing a secondary role.\nThese other drivers of greenness mean we aren’t confident enough in the method to extrapolate it more widely. Follow-up work should use methods like chemical tracers to validate increases in greenness against the supply of ocean nutrients.\nOur study does offer a tantalizing hint as to the possibility of using satellite images to better measure the footprint of salmon nutrients in trees.\nThe paper Salmon abundance and patterns of forest greenness as measured by satellite imagery was published in Science of the Total Environment."

    "text": "Marine reserves are a popular management tool for recovering depleted fish stocks. However, before fishers receive the long-term benefits of spillover from the reserve, they must endure a short-term decline in harvest. A short-term loss in harvest may be untenable for some fishers, particularly those relying on the fishery to feed their families.\nWe used models of a coral reef fishery to ask how the short-term burden of a reserve can be lessened. Many coral reef fisheries are depleted but also support many millions of fishers world-wide, so our study has high practical relevance. We considered different scenarios for creating a reserve, that lessen the burden, including:\n\nGradually increasing the reserve size, up to a target size, each year\nGradually increasing the number of months a year an area is closed to fishing\nGradually increasing the number species protected within a reserve\n\nWe found that gradually bringing in the reserve over multiple years lessened the short-term burden, but still brought the same long-term benefits of spillover and improved harvest. However, there was a trade-off: it took longer for the fishery to fully recover.\nWe found that gradually bringing in the reserve over multiple years lessened the short-term burden, but still brought the same long-term benefits of spillover and improved harvest. However, there was a trade-off: it took longer for the fishery to fully recover.\nSo, a gradual approach to bringing in a reserve can be better for people and still result in the same long-term benefits. In practice, the approach taken will depend on the local situation. For instance, gradually building the size of a reserve may be easier to enforce than limiting what fish species people can catch."

    "text": "The statistics\nThere are many statistics and studies on equity, especially gender equity, in the scientific workforce. So many in fact that it is overwhelming and you could spend a whole day just going over those.\nI looked up some statistics most relevant to our university and Australian research culture.\nGriffith Uni recently convened a university level panel on equity and diversity, which submitted a report to the Athena Swan program. The program is a kind of certification for universities to say they are doing something, you can read more about our efforts here.\nThe report is full of statistics about equity and diversity at Griffith. These are typical of many universities in Australia. So I highlighted a few.\nFirst, at academic levels A and B (i.e. lecturer/postdoc levels), there are more women than men. At academic level C (senior lecturer/senior researcher), there are only just more men than women. By academic level E (full professor) there are about 2x as many men as women.\nThis is the classic pipeline issue, where women ‘drop-out’ of the later stages due to complex interaction between life choices (e.g. having children), sexism, preferential selection of male candidates and lack of female role models.\nGriffith has been working towards addressing this issue for over 5 years now, thanks mostly (I think) to leadership from some very senior female staff (for instance by creating women’s promotion workshops). As a result the rate of successful promotion applications has gone from being much higher for men in 2014 to just about equal when comparing men to women.\nThe rate of female staff applying for promotion has also been going up over time and is also just about equal now.\nOur most esteemed research funder, the Australian Research Council, also has an issue. For instance, there is a so called daversity issue where over a period of years 51 men called David have lead ARC grants, but only 6 Suzannes (the most common female name)."

Viv Tulloch asked the team if they would like to share a positive or negative story about gender.\nI don’t want to share other people’s stories here, but a few general trends emerged.\nThere were many positives. Some people noted more collaborative working in diverse teams. Others noted that diverse teams could be more sympathetic to difficult circumstances, so may improve staff mental health. Others just told stories about how they had felt supported in the past.\nA big positive for me personally (obviously I’m a man) is that having a more diverse workforce makes work more supportive and enjoyable. For instance, I recognized that I was able to take paid primary carer’s leave to care for my baby this year when my wife went back to work. That I could get paid leave was only because of the many mothers before me who fought to have paid primary carer’s leave in Australian universities.\nI’ve also seen through my work on Griffith’s Athena Swan panel that the focus on solving the ‘pipeline’ issue end up benefitting everyone. It motivated the University to look more closely at career development issues for early career researchers, regardless of gender or background. As a consequence they have a greater focus now on career development and new programs, like early career grants, that are open to every researcher.\nOn the negative side I was shocked to hear quite a number of stories from people’s past careers of bias in interview panels. This included being encouraged by senior staff not to hire young women in case they had children, and interview panels considering women unfit for dirty field work.\nSuch questions and considerations about personal circumstances, or bias on the basis of race or gender, are obviously illegal, but it seems that they remain an issue for many women."

    "text": "When we perform a statistical test we’d like to have confidence what the Type I error rate is what we say it is (rate of false positive findings). Often scientists choose a rate (AKA ‘alpha’) of 0.05 for rejecting the null hypothesis.\nWe’d like some guarantees that our statistical test will actually have a type I rate of 5% over many, many repeated trials. For many statistical tests theory does in fact guarantee a 5% error rate over many many repeated trials.\nThe paper Universal inference from Wasserman et al. published in PNAS proposes a new test that guarantees a given Type I error rate for some types of statistical tests that previously didn’t have an appropriate test.\nHere I’ll attempt to code their method in R.\nI say ‘attempt’ because I’m not at all sure I interpreted their paper correctly. So please don’t take this blog as a ‘how to’ for the method. Instead, treat it as an exploration of type I and type II errors and how we can check them.\nFeel free to email me (chris.brown@griffith.edu.au) if you have suggestions on this blog.\nThe method is based on likelihood ratio tests, so at the very least we’ll get to learn about LRTs in this blog.\nIf you are seriously interested in using universal inference, I suggest you consult a statistician.\n\n\nLet’s first test if a some data drawn from a normal distribution are consistent with a null that the mean = 0.\nWe’ll define the data:\nmu &lt;- 0.4\nn &lt;- 100\nset.seed(42)\ny &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = mu)\nNow, do a likelihood ratio test the usual way:\n(test_stat &lt;- 2*(sum(dnorm(y, mean(y), sd(y), log = TRUE)) - sum(dnorm(y, 0, sd(y), log = TRUE))))\n\n## [1] 17.25054\n\n1 - pchisq(test_stat, 1)\n\n## [1] 3.276042e-05\nWe just compared the likelihoods of the data given a mean of zero versus the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean (which is just the mean of the data). Then we take that ratio and find its quantile on the chisq, that’s our (very small) p-value = 3.27E-5.\nIf we were using linear models, we could do the same thing like this:\nm1 &lt;- lm(y~1) #intercept only, ie a mean\nm0 &lt;- lm(y~0) #no intercept, so mean = -\nanova(m0, m1, test = \"Chisq\")\n\n## Analysis of Variance Table\n##\n## Model 1: y ~ 0\n## Model 2: y ~ 1\n##   Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq  Pr(&gt;Chi)    \n## 1    100 126.06                           \n## 2     99 107.36  1    18.707 3.276e-05 ***\n## ---\n## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n\nWasserman et al. propose a ‘split LRT’ where we split the data in half. This has some pleasing similarities to out of sample validation. As I understand it, this is how we’d do the test:\nFirst split the data at random:\ni &lt;- sample(1:n, n/2, replace = FALSE)\ny0 &lt;- y[i]\ny1 &lt;- y[-i]\nNow calculate the MLEs for both splits:\nmu0 &lt;- mean(y0)\nsd0 &lt;- sd(y0)\n\nmu1 &lt;- mean(y1)\nsd1 &lt;- sd(y1)\nThen our split test statistic is (note we are taking likelihood of the y0 split split using the y1 split’s mean):\nsplit_test_stat0 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y0, mu1, sd1, log = TRUE)) -\n                         sum(dnorm(y0, 0, sd1, log = TRUE))\nAnd we can ask if its significant like this:\nexp(split_test_stat0) &gt;= 1/0.05\n\n## [1] TRUE\nTRUE, so reject the null, which is the same result as our Chi square test above.\nThey also propose a cross-fit test, that is just the average of the two split tests:\nsplit_test_stat1 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y1, mu0, sd0, log = TRUE)) -\n  sum(dnorm(y1, 0, sd0, log = TRUE))\nsplit_test_stat &lt;- (split_test_stat1 + split_test_stat0)/2\nexp(split_test_stat) &gt;= 1/0.05\n\n## [1] TRUE\n\n\n\nWhat about the test’s power? Well it seems a shortcoming is that the split LRT can have lower power (higher type II rate, or chance of missing real differences) than some other tests. So for a simple test like that above we are better of doing the test the regular way.\nLet’s check its power for our simple test vs a chisq. I’ll write a function to do this, then iterate it.\nsplitLRT &lt;- function(seed, n, mu){\n  set.seed(seed)\n  y &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = mu)\n  i &lt;- sample(1:n, n/2, replace = FALSE)\n\n  y0 &lt;- y[i]\n  y1 &lt;- y[-i]\n\n  mu0 &lt;- mean(y0)\n  sd0 &lt;- sd(y0)\n\n  mu1 &lt;- mean(y1)\n  sd1 &lt;- sd(y1)\n\n  #split test stat\n  split_test_stat0 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y0, mu1, sd1, log = TRUE)) -\n                         sum(dnorm(y0, 0, sd1, log = TRUE))\n  split_test_stat1 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y1, mu0, sd0, log = TRUE)) -\n  sum(dnorm(y1, 0, sd0, log = TRUE))\n  split_test_stat &lt;- (split_test_stat1 + split_test_stat0)/2\n\n\n  #regular Chisq LRT\n  test_stat &lt;- 2*(sum(dnorm(y, mean(y), sd(y), log = TRUE)) - sum(dnorm(y, 0, sd(y), log = TRUE)))\n  chisqtest &lt;- 1 - pchisq(test_stat, 1)\n\n  #output results as a dataframe\n  data.frame(splitLRT = exp(split_test_stat), chisq = chisqtest)\n}\nNow let’s use our function:\nxout &lt;- lapply(1:1000, splitLRT, n = 50, mu = 0.5)\ndfout &lt;- do.call(\"rbind\", xout)\nsum(dfout$splitLRT &gt;= (1/0.05))/1000\n\n## [1] 0.415\n\nsum(dfout$chisq &lt;= 0.05)/1000\n\n## [1] 0.932\nSo the split test only rejects the null 41.5% of the time, whereas the chisq rejects it 93% of the time. In other words the split test comes at the cost of lower power, as is explained in the paper.\nIt would be worth trying the suggestion in the paper of using k-fold cross-validation to do the splits too, maybe that would improve the power.\nFor larger sample sizes, the split test method does better:\nxout &lt;- lapply(1:1000, splitLRT, n = 150, mu = 0.5)\ndfout &lt;- do.call(\"rbind\", xout)\nsum(dfout$splitLRT &gt;= (1/0.05))/1000\n\n## [1] 0.974\n\nsum(dfout$chisq &lt;= 0.05)/1000\n\n## [1] 1\n\n\n\nThe example I give above is illustrative only, there are theoretical reasons not to use the regular Chi sq test for such a simple model.\nIt would be interesting to try the split LRT for more sophisticated models where tests don’t currently exist. Wasserman et al. suggest its use for a number of models that ecologists use regularly, including mixing models (where data are generated from a mix of distributions), testing latent variables (such as in the multispecies hierarchical models, like BORAL, that we love here) and for structural equation models."

    "text": "What about the test’s power? Well it seems a shortcoming is that the split LRT can have lower power (higher type II rate, or chance of missing real differences) than some other tests. So for a simple test like that above we are better of doing the test the regular way.\nLet’s check its power for our simple test vs a chisq. I’ll write a function to do this, then iterate it.\nsplitLRT &lt;- function(seed, n, mu){\n  set.seed(seed)\n  y &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = mu)\n  i &lt;- sample(1:n, n/2, replace = FALSE)\n\n  y0 &lt;- y[i]\n  y1 &lt;- y[-i]\n\n  mu0 &lt;- mean(y0)\n  sd0 &lt;- sd(y0)\n\n  mu1 &lt;- mean(y1)\n  sd1 &lt;- sd(y1)\n\n  #split test stat\n  split_test_stat0 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y0, mu1, sd1, log = TRUE)) -\n                         sum(dnorm(y0, 0, sd1, log = TRUE))\n  split_test_stat1 &lt;- sum(dnorm(y1, mu0, sd0, log = TRUE)) -\n  sum(dnorm(y1, 0, sd0, log = TRUE))\n  split_test_stat &lt;- (split_test_stat1 + split_test_stat0)/2\n\n\n  #regular Chisq LRT\n  test_stat &lt;- 2*(sum(dnorm(y, mean(y), sd(y), log = TRUE)) - sum(dnorm(y, 0, sd(y), log = TRUE)))\n  chisqtest &lt;- 1 - pchisq(test_stat, 1)\n\n  #output results as a dataframe\n  data.frame(splitLRT = exp(split_test_stat), chisq = chisqtest)\n}\nNow let’s use our function:\nxout &lt;- lapply(1:1000, splitLRT, n = 50, mu = 0.5)\ndfout &lt;- do.call(\"rbind\", xout)\nsum(dfout$splitLRT &gt;= (1/0.05))/1000\n\n## [1] 0.415\n\nsum(dfout$chisq &lt;= 0.05)/1000\n\n## [1] 0.932\nSo the split test only rejects the null 41.5% of the time, whereas the chisq rejects it 93% of the time. In other words the split test comes at the cost of lower power, as is explained in the paper.\nIt would be worth trying the suggestion in the paper of using k-fold cross-validation to do the splits too, maybe that would improve the power.\nFor larger sample sizes, the split test method does better:\nxout &lt;- lapply(1:1000, splitLRT, n = 150, mu = 0.5)\ndfout &lt;- do.call(\"rbind\", xout)\nsum(dfout$splitLRT &gt;= (1/0.05))/1000\n\n## [1] 0.974\n\nsum(dfout$chisq &lt;= 0.05)/1000\n\n## [1] 1"

In a new study we highlight how filling gaps in the assessment of coastal wetlands may help advance coastal wetlands.\nEcosystem assessment frameworks, like the Ocean Health Index, the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems and environmental-economic accounting systems, play important roles in management and conservation (see below image).\n\n\n\nLifecycle of an indicator\n\n\nImage: Lifecycle of ecosystem assessments and conservation action. Image from the study and created by Ryan Pearson.\nAssessments motivate data collection and synthesis of the status of ecosystems, whether it be for human values like fisheries or natural values like biodiversity. The findings of assessments can then determine what ecosystems require conservation actions and what type of actions need to happen.\nWe reviewed five global assessment frameworks and found all shared similar gaps when it comes to assessing coastal wetland ecosystems.\nFirst, animal-habitat linkages are poorly understood. So the assessment frameworks did not properly capture the role that protecting wetlands play in conserving threatened species and supporting productive fisheries.\nSecond, there are numerous data gaps we need to fill at the global scale. Recent strides have been made in applying big data to fill gaps in global measurements of mangrove ecosystems. We now need similar efforts to fill gaps in trends and status of seagrass and saltmarsh.\nOur study has highlighted the role that global assessments play in conservation outcomes. The next aim for our team is to produce a global assessments for all coastal wetland ecosystems. By doing so we hope to give these important ecosystems more exposure to conservation managers."

    "title": "What is the future of coral reefs? - ICRS summary",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Coral reef ecosystems face unprecedented threats, but stories of people give me hope for the future\nThe International Coral Reef Symposium in Honolulu comes on the back of the worst global coral bleaching event yet observed. Global disasters often leave people wondering what hope there is for the future - particularly given insufficient attempts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nSource: http://twitter.com\n\n\nCoral reefs will never be the same as they were. I once saw a talk from Charlie Veron about his efforts to create a global coral atlas (at the conference he announced this is now online). He has dived perhaps more of the world’s reefs than anyone. In an incredibly depressing ending to his talk he stated no-one will ever get to experience coral reefs as he has.\n\n\nCommunicating the loss of coral reefs has been emphasised as an important role for scientists at earlier meetings. A few years ago the rhetoric was all about how scientists need to get out there more - engage with public, get in the media, influence policy, be a force on social media. We do all of this now.\nI actually met, in person, a professional science communicator at this conference. I am sure scicomm people were around at earlier conferences, but not common enough for me to meet one.\nSocial media use is a key part of this engagement. Terry Hughes noted in a panel session that every politician has a twitter account, so if they believe it can change people’s minds, we need to be on there too. As an example, Knowlton talked about the incredible success of the []#oceanoptimism](https://twitter.com/hashtag/oceanoptimism?src=hash) hashtag for engaging the public with ocean solutions through twitter.\nSocial media use at ICRS is orders of magnitude greater than at earlier conferences. Twitter is increasingly popular and the #ICRS2016 hashtag has had widespread impact. A few quick web searches suggest #ICRS2016 had ~240 users and reached over 540 000 people. Check out the #ICRS2016 feed or some of the top tweeters e.g. @OneSwellLife, @physiologyfish and @ultimatemegs to read about the action.\nThese efforts to communicate were apparent at this conference in a subtle way too - the conversation has moved away from how we need communicate, and instead is now about how we can communicate better.\nPeter Kareiva and John Pandolfi both spoke about the need to communicate more of the nuances of science to the media - especially the uncertainty inherent in forecasting the future under different policies. Kareiva used the example of the message box, a commonly used tool for turning academic science into stories for the media or policy. He argued that while this is a useful tool, there it does nothing to help us communicate critical thresholds, impacts and uncertainty - key issues in much of reef science.\nIn her plenary Nancy Knowlton acknowledged the improvement in communication in coral reef science. However, she implored us to tell stories not statistics. In particularly, stories of people. Terry Pratchett, the sci-fi author once said we shouldn’t be called Homo sapiens, the ‘intelligent human’, but Pan narrans the story telling ape (thanks to Beth Fulton for that quote).\nAnd it is stories of people that give me hope for coral reefs.\n\n\n\nCinner and colleagues published a paper about coral reef bright spots last week - places where society and managers are doing better than we would expect at managing reef fish (also presented at ICRS2016). ‘Brights spots’ has become an oft repeated meme at this conference.\nOne of these ‘bright spots’ is Palau and we saw two plenaries about the island nation. The President Remengesau of Palau spoke on day one about the nation’s solution’s orientated approach to reef management. Palau is a world leader in declaring protected areas. Palau’s leadership perhaps stems from a strong traditional management culture. Thus, Palau is a key study area where we can learn about successful management.\nI am finding the study of society’s role in management success brings much more ocean optimism than the pure ecological study of reefs.\nWhen I started my career everyone was saying ecological and physical scientists need to collaborate more with economists and social scientists, but barely anyone was doing so. Now things are turning around.\nBy bringing together social sciences, economists and ecologists we creating a solution orientated science. As Knowlton and others have oft stated, solutions are what give us hope and empower people to take action.\nThe power of solutions is evidenced in the feelings of colleagues at this conference. Colleagues how primarily attended talks about the recent bleaching event were overwhelmingly depressed about the future of reefs, whereas those attending the numerous sessions on marine fishery management, social science, co-management were more optimistic.\nThere is growing acceptance that, while reefs will never return to their previous glory, we can make a better future.\nIn his plenary Pete Mumby talked about the need to study the subtleties of coral reefs. He argued we are facing a future with many ‘mediocre’ reefs, whereas in the past we have focussed our ecological studies on the best of the best, or the worst of the worst. Even degraded reefs can provide services to humans and support significant biodiversity. We need to better understand how management can maximise these benefits.\nAn important part of understanding trends is documenting the past - so much of which has not been recorded by science. But the past is documented in people’s stories, which Loren Mclenachan, Ruth Thurstan and others are using to push back our understanding. For instance newspaper articles can document historical fish catch (Thurstan) and nautical charts can document erosion of reefs (Mclenachan).\nOur future may be dominated by compromises between social, economic and ecological goals. It is hard for the reefs to have their fish and for us to eat them too. Charles Birkeland argued in his plenary that coral reef ecosystems tend to import production not export production. Therefore, they cannot sustain industrial fishing. He talked about Palau’s scenario where its reefs have supported traditional fishing for generations, but the influx of tourists wanting to eat reef fish cannot be supported. Keeping to the solutions theme, he suggested focussing on much more productive pelagic fisheries to support tourism.\nThe realisation that compromises on ecological quality are needed to support human needs has seen the rise of ‘trade-offs’ analysis. Crow White gave a great introduction to the key steps to trade-offs analysis.\nImportantly, trade-offs can help us identify optimal compromises, that are often far better than the status-quo for both people and ecosystems.\nBozec has shown a strong trade-off between harvest of parrotfish and the resilience of coral reefs. However, the right type of management (banning trap fishing) can significantly improve the situation. Aaron MacNeil has similarly found the right type of management is key for fish recovery globally.\nTrade-offs analysis is useful for pollution problems too. Kirstin Oleson and her lab are applying trade-offs analysis to ridge to reef management. They are finding that focussing restoration efforts in just a few areas in catchments can be a very cheap way to reduce sedimentation on reefs.\n\n\n\nDevelopments in social science, the study of management and communication give me hope for the future of reefs. However, some ongoing trends in the culture of reef science give me cause for concern.\n\n\n\nThere are so many women doing amazing work for coral reefs at this conference. So why don’t they receive more recognition from our community? Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nThere is still a strong gender bias in coral reef science. Perhaps this is a hangover from the past, however I think it isn’t changing fast enough. I would estimate that talks and attendance at this conference is approximately 50:50, however it is easy to see that women are not provided with the same opportunities in our field as the men.\nOne story I heard was of a workshop where a senior (male) scientist said he would have liked to have invited more women, but “there just aren’t that many good female scientists to invite”.\nNot all sexism is this blatant.\nCoral reef science as discipline has a problem with insufficient opportunity for women to receive recognition for their work\nThe culture of science overwhelming recognises the volume of achievements. Often women have shorter careers than men, therefore the volume of female achievements is often on average smaller. This does not mean the quality of their work is lower. We often seem to conflate quality and quantity when we recognise leaders of our field.\nI don’t think there is any lack of ‘good’ female reef scientists. In fact, some of the most compelling talks I have seen at ICRS were given by women (take Lizzie Mcleod’s for example).\nIt is important to note that both men and women and subject to this bias. I have discussed these issues with both male and female colleagues and both genders often find it harder to think of female leaders of our field.\nTo give some examples, this year we saw the award of the 7th Darwin medal, the International Society for Reef Studies top award. There has never been a female laureate of the Darwin Medal.\nThe chance of having no females in 7 Darwin medals is less than 1%\nMaybe the award just reflects a historical hangover of what used to be a male dominated field? I don’t think that’s the whole story. We saw a panel discussion on Wednesday night, that was meant to represent some leaders in our field discussing top issues. There were 2 women on a ten person panel.The chance of having two women out of ten people is 5% (reasonably assuming a 50:50 gender ratio at the conference). In science we often treat a 5% chance ‘statistically significant’, so therefore, 2/10 indicates a significant gender bias.\nI want to be clear that I am not criticising any individual or organization. I do not intend to discredit individuals who have received accolades - they certainly deserved them. Neither am I criticising the International Society for Reef Studies.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Coral reef ecosystems face unprecedented threats, but stories of people give me hope for the future\nThe International Coral Reef Symposium in Honolulu comes on the back of the worst global coral bleaching event yet observed. Global disasters often leave people wondering what hope there is for the future - particularly given insufficient attempts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nSource: http://twitter.com\n\n\nCoral reefs will never be the same as they were. I once saw a talk from Charlie Veron about his efforts to create a global coral atlas (at the conference he announced this is now online). He has dived perhaps more of the world’s reefs than anyone. In an incredibly depressing ending to his talk he stated no-one will ever get to experience coral reefs as he has.\n\n\nCommunicating the loss of coral reefs has been emphasised as an important role for scientists at earlier meetings. A few years ago the rhetoric was all about how scientists need to get out there more - engage with public, get in the media, influence policy, be a force on social media. We do all of this now.\nI actually met, in person, a professional science communicator at this conference. I am sure scicomm people were around at earlier conferences, but not common enough for me to meet one.\nSocial media use is a key part of this engagement. Terry Hughes noted in a panel session that every politician has a twitter account, so if they believe it can change people’s minds, we need to be on there too. As an example, Knowlton talked about the incredible success of the []#oceanoptimism](https://twitter.com/hashtag/oceanoptimism?src=hash) hashtag for engaging the public with ocean solutions through twitter.\nSocial media use at ICRS is orders of magnitude greater than at earlier conferences. Twitter is increasingly popular and the #ICRS2016 hashtag has had widespread impact. A few quick web searches suggest #ICRS2016 had ~240 users and reached over 540 000 people. Check out the #ICRS2016 feed or some of the top tweeters e.g. @OneSwellLife, @physiologyfish and @ultimatemegs to read about the action.\nThese efforts to communicate were apparent at this conference in a subtle way too - the conversation has moved away from how we need communicate, and instead is now about how we can communicate better.\nPeter Kareiva and John Pandolfi both spoke about the need to communicate more of the nuances of science to the media - especially the uncertainty inherent in forecasting the future under different policies. Kareiva used the example of the message box, a commonly used tool for turning academic science into stories for the media or policy. He argued that while this is a useful tool, there it does nothing to help us communicate critical thresholds, impacts and uncertainty - key issues in much of reef science.\nIn her plenary Nancy Knowlton acknowledged the improvement in communication in coral reef science. However, she implored us to tell stories not statistics. In particularly, stories of people. Terry Pratchett, the sci-fi author once said we shouldn’t be called Homo sapiens, the ‘intelligent human’, but Pan narrans the story telling ape (thanks to Beth Fulton for that quote).\nAnd it is stories of people that give me hope for coral reefs.\n\n\n\nCinner and colleagues published a paper about coral reef bright spots last week - places where society and managers are doing better than we would expect at managing reef fish (also presented at ICRS2016). ‘Brights spots’ has become an oft repeated meme at this conference.\nOne of these ‘bright spots’ is Palau and we saw two plenaries about the island nation. The President Remengesau of Palau spoke on day one about the nation’s solution’s orientated approach to reef management. Palau is a world leader in declaring protected areas. Palau’s leadership perhaps stems from a strong traditional management culture. Thus, Palau is a key study area where we can learn about successful management.\nI am finding the study of society’s role in management success brings much more ocean optimism than the pure ecological study of reefs.\nWhen I started my career everyone was saying ecological and physical scientists need to collaborate more with economists and social scientists, but barely anyone was doing so. Now things are turning around.\nBy bringing together social sciences, economists and ecologists we creating a solution orientated science. As Knowlton and others have oft stated, solutions are what give us hope and empower people to take action.\nThe power of solutions is evidenced in the feelings of colleagues at this conference. Colleagues how primarily attended talks about the recent bleaching event were overwhelmingly depressed about the future of reefs, whereas those attending the numerous sessions on marine fishery management, social science, co-management were more optimistic.\nThere is growing acceptance that, while reefs will never return to their previous glory, we can make a better future.\nIn his plenary Pete Mumby talked about the need to study the subtleties of coral reefs. He argued we are facing a future with many ‘mediocre’ reefs, whereas in the past we have focussed our ecological studies on the best of the best, or the worst of the worst. Even degraded reefs can provide services to humans and support significant biodiversity. We need to better understand how management can maximise these benefits.\nAn important part of understanding trends is documenting the past - so much of which has not been recorded by science. But the past is documented in people’s stories, which Loren Mclenachan, Ruth Thurstan and others are using to push back our understanding. For instance newspaper articles can document historical fish catch (Thurstan) and nautical charts can document erosion of reefs (Mclenachan).\nOur future may be dominated by compromises between social, economic and ecological goals. It is hard for the reefs to have their fish and for us to eat them too. Charles Birkeland argued in his plenary that coral reef ecosystems tend to import production not export production. Therefore, they cannot sustain industrial fishing. He talked about Palau’s scenario where its reefs have supported traditional fishing for generations, but the influx of tourists wanting to eat reef fish cannot be supported. Keeping to the solutions theme, he suggested focussing on much more productive pelagic fisheries to support tourism.\nThe realisation that compromises on ecological quality are needed to support human needs has seen the rise of ‘trade-offs’ analysis. Crow White gave a great introduction to the key steps to trade-offs analysis.\nImportantly, trade-offs can help us identify optimal compromises, that are often far better than the status-quo for both people and ecosystems.\nBozec has shown a strong trade-off between harvest of parrotfish and the resilience of coral reefs. However, the right type of management (banning trap fishing) can significantly improve the situation. Aaron MacNeil has similarly found the right type of management is key for fish recovery globally.\nTrade-offs analysis is useful for pollution problems too. Kirstin Oleson and her lab are applying trade-offs analysis to ridge to reef management. They are finding that focussing restoration efforts in just a few areas in catchments can be a very cheap way to reduce sedimentation on reefs.\n\n\n\nDevelopments in social science, the study of management and communication give me hope for the future of reefs. However, some ongoing trends in the culture of reef science give me cause for concern.\n\n\n\nThere are so many women doing amazing work for coral reefs at this conference. So why don’t they receive more recognition from our community? Source: http://twitter.com\n\n\nThere is still a strong gender bias in coral reef science. Perhaps this is a hangover from the past, however I think it isn’t changing fast enough. I would estimate that talks and attendance at this conference is approximately 50:50, however it is easy to see that women are not provided with the same opportunities in our field as the men.\nOne story I heard was of a workshop where a senior (male) scientist said he would have liked to have invited more women, but “there just aren’t that many good female scientists to invite”.\nNot all sexism is this blatant.\nCoral reef science as discipline has a problem with insufficient opportunity for women to receive recognition for their work\nThe culture of science overwhelming recognises the volume of achievements. Often women have shorter careers than men, therefore the volume of female achievements is often on average smaller. This does not mean the quality of their work is lower. We often seem to conflate quality and quantity when we recognise leaders of our field.\nI don’t think there is any lack of ‘good’ female reef scientists.

    "text": "Species on the Move Conference: some key things I learned.\n10-12 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania\nCheck out the conference webpage and my synopses for more details:\n\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\n\n\n\n1. Science tells a story and telling stories in itself is a suitable objective for science\nA great talk from Emma Lee changed the way I think about science. I come from a very quantitative background, where the point of science is knowledge and improving the future for nature and humanity. But Lee convinced me that telling a story is a suitable goal in itself. People love to tell stories, so much so it is almost a basic human need. Science is the way to come closer to the truth in our thinking and in doing so provide an outlet for people to communicate authentic stories.\n\n\n2. Climate change impacts on ecosystems have become a personal experience\nThe effects of climate change are so pervasive now that individuals are noticing it, and often attributing environmental change to climate change. We shouldn’t underestimate the psychological impact of attributing change to climate change.\n\n\n3. Indigenous people are being pushed for answers on problems they didn’t create\nScientists are working with indigenous people to answer questions about climate change, but scientists come with a very strong idea about the method which can create a communication challenge with indigenous people, particularly when they feel the ‘scientific method’ is pushed upon them. Better communication of climate science, and incorporating alternate cultural view-points is a great challenge for all of us, but one we need to address if we are going to solve the problems climate change is posing. Thanks to Nathalie Pettorelli for this one.\n\n\n4. Climate change ecology is a young, dynamic discipline and this makes it really exciting to participate in\nYoung researchers are doing some of the most exciting research in climate change ecology. Jenn Sunday’s plenary was a great example of this. Further, some of the most influential papers have been lead by female scientists, which is not the case in other older fields. I think climate change ecology does not suffer as much from the handicap of sexism as the more ‘established’ fields. The inclusiveness of our field makes it stronger and conferences like this so much more fun and progressive.\n\n\n5. Climate change impacts and management responses are all about the time-scale\nInvasive species are just native species on a shorter timescale. Management also needs to consider time-scales, for instance training managers in the short-term change can help prepare them for longer-term change. Thanks to Nathalie Butt for this one.\n\n\n6. Mangers are already responding to climate change, even while scientists still argue what the appropriate responses are\nBowman’s talk was a great example of a rapid management response to an extreme fire regime. As scientists, we need to make sure we are engaging with managers and helping them learn about how to respond to change.\n…"

    "title": "Smoothing a time-series with a Bayesian model",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently I looked at fitting a smoother to a time-series using Bayesian modelling. Now I will look at how you can control the smoothness by using more or less informative priors on the precision (1/variance) of the random effect.\nWe will use the same dataset as the last post.\nTo control the priors for an R-INLA model, we use the hyper argument (not hyperactive, but hyper-parameters):\nlibrary(INLA)\nf3 &lt;- y ~ 1 + f(z, model = \"rw1\", scale.model = TRUE,\nhyper = list(theta = list(prior=\"pc.prec\", param=c(1,0.01))))\nWe can control the level of smoothing through param=c(theta1,0.01). A value of 1 (theta1) is a reasonable starting point (based on the INLA documentation). Lower values will result in a smoother fit.\nThe pc.param stands for Penalized complexity parameters (you could also use a loggamma prior here). My understanding of penalized complexity priors is that they shrink the parameter estimate towards a ‘base-model’ that is less flexible. In this case, we are shrinking the standard deviation (AKA the flexibility) of the random walk (ie how much sequential data points deviate from each other) towards zero. Ultimately if we set theta1 near zero the smoother will be a straight line.\nSo let’s fit three models with theta1 varying and see how it affects the smoothness of the fit:\nf1 &lt;- y ~ 1 + f(z, model = \"rw1\", scale.model = TRUE,\nhyper = list(theta = list(prior=\"pc.prec\", param=c(0.01,0.01))))\n\nf2 &lt;- y ~ 1 + f(z, model = \"rw1\", scale.model = TRUE,\nhyper = list(theta = list(prior=\"pc.prec\", param=c(0.05,0.01))))\n\nf3 &lt;- y ~ 1 + f(z, model = \"rw1\", scale.model = TRUE,\nhyper = list(theta = list(prior=\"pc.prec\", param=c(1,0.01))))\n\nm1 &lt;- inla(f1,family = \"nbinomial\", data  =  dat,\n    control.predictor = list(compute = TRUE, link = 1)\n)\n\nm2 &lt;- inla(f2,family = \"nbinomial\", data  =  dat,\n    control.predictor = list(compute = TRUE, link = 1)\n)\n\nm3 &lt;- inla(f3,family = \"nbinomial\", data  =  dat,\n    control.predictor = list(compute = TRUE, link = 1)\n)\nHere are the resulting fits:\nplot(dat$z, dat$y, col = 'grey80', type = 'l', lwd = 1, xlab = \"years\", ylab = \"Abundance\", las = 1)\n\nlines(dat$z, m1$summary.fitted.values$mean, col = \"skyblue\", lwd = 2)\nlines(dat$z, m2$summary.fitted.values$mean, col = \"steelblue\", lwd = 2)\nlines(dat$z, m3$summary.fitted.values$mean, col = \"darkblue\", lwd = 2)\n\nlegend('topright', legend = c(\"data\", \"theta1 = 0.01\", \"theta1 = 0.05\", \"theta1 = 1\"),\n      lty = 1, col = c(\"grey80\", \"skyblue\", \"steelblue\", \"darkblue\"), lwd = 2)\n\nThe exact value to use for theta1 will vary depending on our data. If the data are more informative (e.g. a longer time-series) we will have to use a smaller value to create a smoother fit.\ndat2 &lt;- list(y = dat$y[1:40], z = 1:40)\nm4 &lt;- inla(f2,family = \"nbinomial\", data  =  dat2,\n    control.predictor = list(compute = TRUE, link = 1)\n)\nplot(dat$z, dat$y, col = 'grey80', type = 'l', lwd = 1, xlab = \"years\", ylab = \"Abundance\", las = 1)\n\nlines(dat$z, m2$summary.fitted.values$mean, col = \"skyblue\", lwd = 2)\nlines(dat2$z, m4$summary.fitted.values$mean, col = \"steelblue\", lwd = 2)\n\nlegend('topright', legend = c(\"data\", \"theta1 = 0.05, 50 data points\", \"theta1 = 0.05, 40 data points\"),\n      lty = 1, col = c(\"grey80\", \"skyblue\", \"steelblue\"), lwd = 2)\n\nAnd that is pretty much it. I haven’t read how to choose the ‘optimal’ value of theta. Pragmatically, one could do it with cross validation or perhaps a model selection measure. However, that seems philosophically incorrect, because it is a ‘prior’. There doesn’t seem to be much guidance in the literature about how to choose priors for smoothing. Message me on Twitter if you have seen an example of doing this.\nIt is amazing to see how the use of priors in statistics has changed since I first learned about Bayesian statistics. It used to be that you would use informative priors only if you had strong prior beliefs about a parameter estimate, such as from expert elicitation, or repeat experiments. If you didn’t have strong prior beleifs, then the view (at least amongst many ecologists) was that it was most cautious to use a highly uninformative prior like the good old Winbugs gamma(0.01, 0.01) prior that was used for precision parameters.\nNow the experts are encouraging us to use weakly informative priors, even when little prior evidence is available. The case being that too broad a prior can slow computations and result in ridiculous results. Consider the broad gamma(0.01, 0.01) prior: it amounts to giving equal weight to a standard deviation of 1 as it does to an SD of 10000. The end result is that this ‘uninformative prior’ can bias your estimates of the SD to be too high.\nAs demonstrated here, another nice feature of informative priors is they can be used to control ‘shrinkage’. Here by varying theta1 we could shrink our model fit towards a base case model (e.g. a null hypothesis) that had no temporal variation.\nIf you are interested to learn more, it is worth reading at least the Introduction of Simpson et al. Penalized Complexity Priors pub. Other good general guidance can be found on the STAN wiki.\nThere is clearly a lot more fun we can have by playing around with priors. I anticipate that applied scientists, like my ecological colleagues, will soon start paying much more attention to prior choice."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When interpolation doesn’t work with GAMs\nGAMs shouldn’t be used for extrapolation, and they can give strange results for interpolation too. Here I’ll explain why and we’ll look at a solution that involves changing the order a smoother’s penalty. Gaps in an x-covariate, such as gaps in a time-series, can be a problem to deal with if you are trying to interpolate to those gaps. Consider this example data and GAM fit with a big gap in the middle.\nThe below graph shows data as points and a the fit of a GAM:\n\nThere is a strong rising trend for low x and a strong declining trend for high x. The GAM fills in the gap and suggests a polynomial curve.\nThe problem is our predicted y values for intermediate x are much higher than than the range of the observed y values (indicated by the red line. y is predicted to be &gt;2 at x = 0.5, but observations have y always less than about 0.7. So while we aren’t extrapolating on the x-axis, we are extrapolating on the y-axis.\nThere is no straightforward answer to solving this problem. The answer depends on what you know about the system from prior work. Ideally you’d collect more data for the intermediate x values, but if that is not possible here are some options:\n\nKeep the result above if you have reason to believe there truly is a hump shaped relationship between x and y. If you that x causes y and have a theory for that relationship then the extrapolation of y values might be reasonable. This theory would be based on prior work on the two variables.\nKeep the fit above but refrain from making predictions in the gap.\nFit different smooths for the values at the two ends of the spectrum (e.g. by grouping values on the x-axis and using that group as a by variable in the smooth).\nTry a different basis spline for the smooth. See ?smooth.terms for options\nModify the order of the penalty, which can give a fit like this:\n\n\nOption 3 fits the model: gam(y~ s(x, m=1), method = \"REML\"). The m=1 parameter adjusts the order of the penalty for the smooth.\nA brief non-technical description of the m parameter follows. When mgcv fits a spline for a covariate it is balancing the objectives of fitting the data as closely as possible versus fitting the data so closely that the smooth will misrepresent new data. The way mgcv balances these two objectives is to apply a ‘penalty’ that increases the wigglier the smooth gets.\nHow we define ‘wiggly’ for use in the penalty is determined by the m parameter. If m=1, the penalty is applied to the slope of the smoother. If the smooth was a car, this would be like minimizing the number of speeds the car can go. If the car had 3 degrees of freedom it can only go at three speeds, with abrupt jolts when changing between speeds\nThe default is m=2. m=2 is generally preferable because it gives a smoother fit with fewer abrupt changes. The m=2 option applies the penalty to the slope of the slope, AKA the second derivative of the smooth. If we talk about cars again, you could think of this as minimizing the acceleration and deceleration of car. The car can go many speeds, but we are minimizing the rate it shifts between speeds. Of course this would be a smoother ride than the m=1 car.\nTo summarize there is not right answer for this issue of interpolation. There are many options and your choice depends on the system you are studying and how much knowledge you have about its mechanisms."

    "text": "I was excited to learn today that Professor Rod Connolly, Professor Isabelle Côté and I had been awarded an Australian Research Council grant to start in 2018.\nWe will be developing new models to predict how stressors interact to impact marine ecosystems, like seagrass. The work starts in Australia, with modelling and field work locally, but we will be working with Prof Côté to develop applications in Canada too.\nIf you like the sound of this science, watch this space. We will likely be advertising some Honours, PhD and a post-doc position to start next year.\nIf you want to learn more, the press release is below. If you want to know about sciency details, then I just gave a talk in Glasgow on this topic and wrote a blog about it:\nAn international team, led by researchers from the Australian Rivers Institute, Griffith University, have been funded by the Australian Research Council to develop new software tools that will help manage the cumulative impacts that threaten coastal ecosystems.\nEcosystems like seagrass meadows, mangroves and coral reefs are highly threatened but globally important. They provide habitat for fish, support fisheries, capture carbon from the atmosphere and are food for many animals including dugongs.\nDecision makers must manage a bewildering array of threats that coastal ecosystems face. Many coastal ecosystems are threatened by urbanisation, overfishing, pollution and climate change.\n“Managers are often unsure about how to plan for cumulative impacts. They typically have very limited data on how cumulative impacts interact to degrade ecosystems” the grant lead Dr Chris Brown explained. “The tools we aim to develop will help make reliable predictions about cumulative impacts, even where there are little data.”\n“The project thus aims to overcome the largest remaining barrier to effective management of the world’s marine resources” said Professor Rod Connolly, a chief investigator on the grant.\nThe project will begin in Moreton Bay, near to Brisbane. Seagrass ecosystems in Moreton Bay have been in decline for decades due to multiple pressures brought on by urbanisation of Brisbane and surrounds. The team will collect new data to test the ability of the software tools to predict the impact of cumulative impacts, including urbanisation and pollution.\nThe team then aims to scale up the tools developed for Queensland seagrass so they can be used elsewhere.\nThe team also includes Professor Côté from Simon Fraser University in Canada, an international expert on cumulative impacts. Canadian seagrass meadows face many of the same threats as those in Australia, making it a perfect testing ground for the new tools.\n“This is a unique opportunity to provide practical tools, underpinned by strong science, for decision-makers to tackle the most complex issues that affect coasts around the world.” Professor Côté said. “We hope that the results of this project will reduce the amount of guesswork currently involved in managing threatened coastal habitats”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Github Copilot CLI (Command Line Interface) recently became available. It is an AI agent, meaning it can use tools autonomously in a loop. It has two modes:\n\nAn interactive mode that is like a terminal version of the Copilot agent that runs in the chat window\nA programmatic mode that can be run with shell scripts.\n\nThe Copilot CLI is available with paid versions of github copilot.\nThe programmatic mode interested me, because it allows you to write scripts that call github copilot agents. This means you could run replicate agents on the same problem, then gather there results for analysis.\nI, of course, want to do everything from the R program, because I’m not great with unix code or Python. Once you’ve setup the copilot CLI, its very easy to run it from R:\n\ncopilot_cmd &lt;- \"copilot -p 'Set-up this project directory with a readme.md file, and directories for outputs, scripts, plots.' --allow-all-tools\"\n\nsystem(copilot_cmd)\n\nThis will run the agent autonomously in the current working directory of your R session.\nNow I wouldn’t recommend using --allow-all-tools like this however. There are important security considerations. Like prompt injection attacks where an Agent goes on the web and gets tricked into doing something bad to your computer when it reads some malicious content. Likewise, agents can just stuff up and just delete or overwrite a bunch of files you wanted to keep.\nYou do need to allow some tools however, otherwise you might as well run the agent in interactive mode (because you’ll have to manually approve every tool use). This defeats the time-saving goal of running agents in a loop.\nHere’s my current set-up:\ncopilot -p 'A prompt here' --allow-all-tools --deny-tool 'shell(cd)' --deny-tool 'shell(git)' --deny-tool 'shell(pwd)' --deny-tool 'fetch' --deny-tool 'extensions' --deny-tool 'websearch' --deny-tool 'githubRepo'\"\nI allow all tools, then prevent tools related to changing working directory, accessing the web or viewing directory context.\nThere is still some risk here. e.g., if you want it to run Rscripts you might want to include in your prompt something like ‘Use Rscript my-script.R to run R scripts from the terminal.’ The R scripts could include anything (including connecting to the web).\nHere’s an example in action. I use sprintf to format the terminal command with the prompt, tools and sub-directory path.\ncopilot_prompt &lt;- \"Set-up this project directory with a readme.md file, and directories for outputs, scripts, plots. Then create example data to illustrate a poisson GLM. Make prediction plots. Use `Rscript 'my-script.R'` to run R files. \"\n\ncopilot_tools &lt;- \"--allow-all-tools --deny-tool 'shell(cd)' --deny-tool 'shell(git)' --deny-tool 'shell(pwd)' --deny-tool 'fetch' --deny-tool 'extensions' --deny-tool 'websearch' --deny-tool 'githubRepo'\"\n\nsubdir_path &lt;- \"dir1\"\n\n copilot_cmd &lt;- sprintf(\n    \"cd '%s' && copilot -p '%s' %s\",\n    subdir_path,\n    copilot_prompt,\n    copilot_tools\n  )\n\nsystem(copilot_cmd)\n\nFrom here it would be easy to create a loop over different subdirectory paths, and run a separate agent in each one. The advantage of cding into each path before the agent opens is that the agent can’t then see context from other sub-directories. So you get independent agent runs.\nYou could use this to see how different prompts perform, or do complex prompt strategies like ‘tree of thought’. In tree of thought you ask an agent to create the same thing many times, it will do it slightly differently each time. Then you aggregate the results and pick the most common or most accurate one.\nMy one gripe is that Github have provided us with woeful documentation of what the tool names are. I’m guessing the tools are what you can see if you open the chat window, click ‘Agent’ mode, then click the tool symbol.\nI’d love to have some default tool sets that simplify the tool permissions. For instance a tool set that locks down all web access."

    "text": "I have been playing around with spatial modelling in the R INLA package. This blog just records a few thoughts I have had about using INLA for kriging (spatial interpolation). I am keen to discuss these ideas with others.\nKriging is super useful tool for ‘filling in the gaps’ between sampling sites. e.g. see this map. Handy if you want to make a map, or need to match up two spatial data sets that overlap in extent, but have samples at different locations.\nYou can do kriging the old fashioned way in R or even in ARC GIS. The advantage of using INLA though is that you can use Bayesian inference to do your kriging.\nThis means you can interpolate non-normal error structures (like counts or presence/absence data). You can also include other fixed covariates, like a spatial layer of temperatures. Or you can even include, other random effects. For instance, you could do spatio-temporal kriging if you had time-series at each of your sites.\nFor a simple tutorial on spatial modelling in INLA see here or my blog series on making maps from geotagged photos.\nSorry, there will be no code or figures with this post. I can’t share the data for the example I am working on yet. Will post it in a few months if I can.\nSo here are some thoughts I have had while working with my latest INLA model."

    "text": "Grid scale for interpolations\nThe standard advice, that I read somewhere on the INLA page was that the grid size or triangulation you use should have edges that are somewhat smaller than the spatial range parameter (as explained in my blog).\nHowever, I have been finding that tweeking the edge size (e.g. making the cutoff parameer in inla.mesh.2d larger) can be useful for visualising spatial trends at different scales.\nIf you make your grid size much larger than the distance between the closest sites, you get a much better picture of large scale spatial trends.\nSay you have highly clustered sampling and there is a large amount of variability within clusters that swamps large-scale trends. For instance you may be measuring stuff on coral reefs as you sail your boat around. It is likely you will hit up a bunch of sites nearby to each other, then sail off to another reef some distance away then survey another bunch of sites.\nThe end result will be lots of clusters of samples that have large distances between them. Coral reef data are typically highly variable, even at small spatial scales and large-scale (100s km) trends are often quite weak (though real!). Fish surveys are the worst, because fish swim around, often in schools, so often true ecological trends are well hidden under a stack load of observer error.\nIf you interpolate reef data with a very small grid, that matches the scale parameter, you end up with a very patchy looking map. Whereas, if you use a large grid, you get a much smoother looking map that just captures the weaker, but perhaps more important, broadscale trends.\nThis map will hide the considerable local scale variation, so it is worth plotting that as a separate map too.\nEffectively, this is just like doing averages on a small vs large grid.\nI can’t find it right now, but someone did write a guidance tutorial for setting up grids/triangulations for INLA. If you know where it is, let me know and I will post it."

You change it when specifying the matern mesh before fitting your model inla.spde2.matern(mesh, alpha = 1.9).\nLarge values (approaching 2) give smoother trend, whereas values closer to zero will show more of the bumps in a spatial field. Of course, choice of this parameter will interact with how you define your grid.\nIt can make a big difference to your resulting interpolation. I am not sure much advice exists on how to choose it. I would be interested to hear from others what they think.\nTwo ways to choose this parameter would be based on aesthetics of the resulting map (if you are just making a map), or perhaps using cross-validation or information criteria to choose the parameter."

    "section": "Playing with priors to get shrinkage to a null hypothesis",
    "text": "Playing with priors to get shrinkage to a null hypothesis\nSome of the INLA developers and co recently published a cool paper about choosing priors for hyperparameters. The hyperpriors control how much your spatial surface can vary. They are quite hard to set based on true ‘prior evidence’, because they are abstract parameters.\nSimpson and co give an example of the variance parameter in a single dimensional model, but the same idea applies to spatial gradients too. (I also have a blog about hyperpriors for time-series here).\nIf you make your hyperprior on spatial/temporal variance very peaked near zero with a long tail, then effectively it is like saying there is probably no spatial variance and a small chance of lots of spatial variance.\nThe effect in your model will be the spatial trend ‘shrinks’ toward a flat gradient, unless your data are strong enough to overcome the no gradient prior. This is like having a null hypothesis of no gradients.\ne.g. see the last figure in my blog here where a stronger prior effectively fits a model to a time-series with a slope of zero (ie no temporal trend).\nAn even more useful way of thinking about this is that you can play around with the priors to get the desired level of smoothing in your spatial (or temporal) model.\nI think this idea is pretty radical. We are shifting away from thinking that priors should be unininformative if you have no prior data (like in the bad old days of the Winbugs gamma(0.001, 0.001) prior for variances), and towards a philosophy where some priors can be tuned and (specifically hyperpriors for variance parameters) should be very very informative.\nThis is a pretty powerful idea. In effect an informative prior can encode our null hypothesis and a stronger prior will require stronger trends in the data to ‘break away from’ the null hypothesis. If you really want to show your data contain a powerful trend, then try to smash it with a very informative prior that peaks near zero variance.\nAs a hint of a paper I want to work on soon, imagine you have super variable data that have stack loads of observer error and weak ecological trends (like surveys of schooling fish on coral reefs). You want to estimate the ecological gradient under all that noise. Well you could get prior information on the extent of spatial variation attributable to true ecological variable. You could then use that prior information to inform a variance prior that helps you estimate the latent spatial field for true ecological gradient. In effect, you are removing the observer signal.\nThat’s all for now. Email me or tweet me if you like this, or think I am talking rubbish."

Joining datasets is a major, major, timesink.\nSo much so, you could basically say my niche in my field is joining different datasets in new ways. We can get new interesting results, but it can be hard (which is why not everyone is doing it).\nFirst, joins present opportunities for errors. If you are doing a simple join on a shared variable (e.g. with dplyr’s inner_join), but the variable is coded inconsistently across dataframes you might loose data. This might be hard to detect in large datasets.\nSecond, joins might be based more loosely on spatial or temporal similarities. These can get fiddly. Say you want to extract wave height data at some diver survey sites. Just use the coordinates right? Well, what if the wave data doesn’t extend all the way to the coast, or the resolution is too ‘blocky’ and it misses some dive sites? Now you have to invent a way to find wave values near to dive sites, ideally only when wave data are missing. It gets fiddly.\nThe same issue happens with joins on times/dates. Maybe rainfall isn’t measured on the exact day you had bird counts. So perhaps now you impute rainfall to the missing day, but what algorithm of the 1000s possible are you going to use for the imputation?"

Small differences in data wrangling or model formulation can result in logically flawed results.\nMy experience of vibe coding is that it tends to make code that runs, but has mistakes in the critical places.

These are systems that take your initial instructions and then iterate it through creating it and debugging it with minimal or no human intervention.\nAnthropic claims that their latest model can work for hours on software development without need for human intervention. The way it works is that the LLM returns the results of its code to itself, checks those results, then decides on the next action to take.\nAs an ecological modeller I thought these tools could be useful for developing routine R code. Common tasks include data wrangling, building and running various versions of a regression model and then generating plots.\nSo I’ve been experimenting with agentic AI, including with Cline, Roo Code and Github Copilot for ecological statistics."

The problem is that zeros, nights with no nests, are implicit. Monitoring was done every night for three months, and the field team records nesting events the observe.\nI tried vibe coding to calculate mean number of nests per night. It just calculated the mean number out of the total number of unique dates in the dataset. What we actually need to do first is add zeros, nights without nesting, back into the data first. Otherwise, we get a mean that isn’t comparable across years or sites"

So I go through the same code here.\nIf you are starting out with stars, read their manual first.\nBut first some key differences.\nstars is set-up to work with spatio-temporal arrays (terra also has better capacity to work with multilayer rasters than raster did). stars deals with more complex data types than either raster or terra, for instance, stars can handle rotated grids.\nstars works will with sf, and many sf functions have methods for stars objects (like st_bbox and st_transform). In contrast, my current experience of trying to use terra and sf is a bit more awkward. I had to do lots of class conversions of terra objects to sf objects and back again.\nstars isn’t as well documented as raster or terra. Some colleagues told me they’ve had unresolvable issues with stars and reverted to raster.

    "title": "Tips for the design of ecological experiments",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Are you planning an experiment in the lab or field, or an observational study? Its a good idea to talk to a statistician before you start.\nStudents often ask me for help with statistics after they’ve collected their data. However, it’s common they need help with statistics because of issues with the experimental (or observational) design.\nA stats model can never completely fix design flaws. So below are some tips, based on my experiences helping students analyze their datasets.\nExperimental design is complex because ultimately you are balancing logistical practicalities (like cost of sampling) with with is theoretically optimal. This blog is a starting point, but I recommend reading deeper into the references below.\nFor a more complete discussion of experimental design I recommend Quinn and Keough’s classic book: Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists.\nSee also this recent review of four important logical principles that need to be met in design to infer causality.\nThis is a working document for my students, so please write me (chris.brown@griffith.edu.au) if you have suggestions for improvements on the below.\n\n\nJust quickly, below I’ll refer to:\n‘Experiments’ as manipulative experiments in the lab or field. Field studies in particular may also have some elements of ‘Observational’ studies, so there is a grey-area with:\n‘Observational studies’ as field studies that sample across gradients of natural variation to try and identify effects on a response variable (AKA mensurative experiments).\n‘Environmental gradients’ as gradients in a covariate of interest, e.g. rainfall or fishing pressure. These can occur naturally in the field, or be the result of manipulation in an experiment.\n‘Samples’ are the units of observation.\n‘Response’ is the variable(s) of interest that you hypothesize are affected by the treatments and/or covariates.\n‘Covariates’, ‘predictors’ or ‘explanatory’ variables are the hypothesized drivers of changes in the response. Usually we’d use predictor or explanatory variable in the case of a manipulative experiment, whereas any term is fine in the case of an observational study.\n‘Confounded’ means that you cannot distinguish the effects of two predictors. In a field observational study we could say that two covariates are ‘collinear’.\nAll of the experimental design concepts below also apply to analysis of field surveys or pre-existing datasets (e.g. citizen science data or meta-analyses). In these cases you are limited in the pre-existing ‘treatments’ available to you, so you will need to constrain your interpretation based on experimental design principles.\n\n\n\n\n\nUndoubtedly things will fail. Plants die when they’re not meant to, you can’t visit a site because of a suspicious landholder, your volunteer stuffs up a bunch of measurements, someone turns the power off in the lab… There’s a long list of reasons that your design won’t turn out like you planned.\nSo make sure your design is robust to the loss of some of your samples.\n\n\n\nIdeally you’ll have relatively equal sampling intensities across different treatment levels, or along an environmental gradient of interest (but see below).\nIn the old days having equal sample sizes for each treatment level, a ‘balanced design’ was critical for straightforward stats (e.g. with Type I ANOVA). This rule isn’t so strict with modern GLMs and extensions.\nHowever, it is still important to have sufficient sampling across a gradient or levels of a treatment. You need this to be able to estimate the treatment’s effect relative to background variation.\nIts usually straightforward in laboratory experiments to have equal sample sizes of each treatment level. In observational studies, balancing sampling can be more challenging.\nA common issue is insufficient sampling at all combinations of environmental gradients. As an example, I’ve often worked on analyses of how pollution and fishing pressure affect coastal fish abundance. Unfortunately, these gradients are highly confounded: polluted sites are nearer the coast and tend also to have higher fishing pressure. This means it is impossible to separate the effects of pollution and fishing pressure on fish abundance.\nAn improved observational design would include sites with low pollution and high fishing pressure and vice-versa (if they exist). This would enable us to statistically separate the effects of pollution and fishing, as well as estimate their interaction.\n\n\n\n“Stratify experiments with respect to your knowledge and randomise with respect to your ignorance” - Professor Alan T. James, via Bill Venables.\nYou have two broad options for dealing with background variation. You can try and control them, so they are constant across all samples. For instance, in an experiment you may keep temperature constant, so you can examine the effects of nutrients on algal growth.\nControlled designs have greater power to detect changes of interest. However, they are less general (the results of the algae experiment above only applies at one temperature) and more susceptible to overestimating the effect of a covariate.\nAn alternative option is to randomize your sampling with respect to background sources of variation. Such a design will have reduced power compared to a controlled design, but the effect sizes you estimate will be more general and realistic (typically they are smaller).\nIf you go with randomisation you may want to try increase replication, to address power issues.\n\n\n\nRandom sampling is the basic assumption underlying most stats tests.\nWatch out for sample selection methods that masquerade as random sampling. Ad-hoc sampling, like throwing a quadrat around the intertidal zone, can result in biased inferences.\nFor instance, in a mangrove forest you’d have to be careful to sample both sparse and dense patches of forest. Identifying sample locations beforehand with randomly picked GPS points is one way to address this.\nAnother example is citizen science data, which tends to be heavily biased by accessibility of sites.\nStats can help overcome non-random sampling - you can control statistically for non-random designs if you have some idea of the drivers of sampling (like distance to cities for citsci). But you’ll need to know the drivers well enough to model them.\n\n\n\nPsuedo-replication means your samples aren’t truly independent. The classic example is a design of fish in tanks. If you have 10 tanks and 5 fish in each tank, your replicates are tanks, fish in tanks are psuedo-reps (because they share the same water).\nThis issue can be hidden. For instance, climate change tank experiments often have a single water circulation system per treatment level (e.g. controlling OA or temperature). This means all the replicate tanks on the same system aren’t truly independent samples. Solutions are to have one circulation system per treatment (but expensive!) or run the experiment multiple times to get temporally independent samples.\nIf you have psuedo-replication its not the end of the world. Mixed effects models (e.g. with lme4) are how you model that.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve identified psuedo-replication you may want to use a blocking design to deal with the issue.\nFor example, say you are applying different nutrient and temperature treatments to see how it affects algae growth. You can only grow 10 samples of algae per week and your target is 50 samples. So you will run the experiment over 5 weeks, doing 10 samples per week.\nIdeally, you will want to run every nutrient and temperature treatment every week, so you can separate the effect of ‘week’ from your treatment effects.\nBut say you only have one incubation chamber for maintaining a constant temperature. So each week can only be one temperature. Then you’ll want to either: run the same temperature over multiple weeks or, run a gradient of temperatures (see below). Within each week you will still run every nutrient level. You will also want to randomize the order that the temperature treatments are applied.\nThis will ensure you can estimate the temperature effect and how it applies across different nutrient levels. Multiple samples across weeks will let you remove (statistically) that nuisance variable.\n\n\n\nEasy answer: maximize replication over measuring ‘everything’ at each sample.\nInitial plans I see from students, especially for field designs, often involve measuring a lot of variables at very few sites. But, such designs end up with have low power and a lot of confounded variables, because you end up with more covariates to test than samples to test them.\nYou have a better chance of getting a useful and interesting result if you focus on just a few major patterns. Then you can sample more sites and get replication numbers up.\nAs an example, imagine you can sample 3 sites per day to do rapid assessments of insect taxa diversity and forest structure, or take 2 days to make a detailed assessment of a single site, including document all plant and insect species. The rapid assessment could get you to 42 sites over 3 weeks, versus only 7 sites for the detailed assessment. 42 sites is getting up towards a sample size that is useful for regression modelling (e.g. with glm), whereas 7 is far from enough.\nOf course the replication level you need depends on how variable the system is, but in my (marine fish biased) experience of analyzing ecological field experiments, ~50 independent sites is usually a minimum.\nI’ll add that if you can easily sample more covariates, go for it. You may want to condition on them to statistically control for them when you do the analysis.\n\n\n\nDeveloping a conceptual model of your system, through talking with experts and reading the literature, can help you identify key predictors and refine your research question. This means you can better target your sampling design.\n\n\n\nClosely related to the above idea, I often see students intensely replicating their designs at very few sites (e.g. doing many days of sampling at a single site, or numerous transects per site). But these are psuedoreps. Your study will be more general if you can cover more sites with less replication at each site.\nAiming for greater replication can also help you obtain a deeper understanding of your study topic. You’ll see more different circumstances which may help you formulate better hypotheses.\n\n\n\nEasy answer: gradient designs are better for prediction, and designing for prediction is the future of ecology.\nBut, replicated designs have more power to detect monotonically increasing responses to the predictor.\nSay we are doing an experiment measuring how fast algae grow in flasks under different nutrient levels. We can fit 30 flasks in the lab. Here’s three ways to assign them to nutrient levels: Gradient (every flask gets a different nutrient level), replicated (just two nutrient levels), or hybrid of gradient and replicated.\n What should you do?\nThe replicated design is more typical of ecological experiments. This design gives you the greatest power to detect an effect of nutrients on algae growth (meaning best chance to find p&lt;0.05 if there is an effect).\nReplicated designs may also be preferred for practical reasons, for instance, it may be expensive or time consuming to have multiple levels of the treatment (e.g. requiring multiple different incubators in a warming experiment).\nBUT, there’s a catch. What if your ecological response shows a humped or saturating relationship with the predictor variable? Then your replicated design implies a straight-line relationship between the two levels, e.g. here are results of a gradient vs replicated design for a curved relationship:\n\nSo your ability to predict the ecological response is very poor with the replicated design.\nThis studies provides a series of analyses with simulated and real data to compare our ability to predict with different designs.\nThe above graph assumes you at equal intervals along the gradient. If you know there are regions of rapid change in your response, you could intensify your sampling around those regions.\nHybrid designs are a compromise on prediction and power and may work well in many cases.\nEcology desperately needs to become more ‘predictive’ for a whole heap of reasons, including being able to inform ecosystem management, predict effects of multiple stressors, and for testing fundamental theories. So I encourage you to consider a gradient or hybrid design.\nWhen designing a gradient, look out for high leverage points, e.g. one temperature extreme 5 degrees greater than any of your other treatments/surveys (with no replication) will have a high influence on your fitted model.\n\n\n\nThe classic example is early ocean acidification experiments that acidified water in experimental treatments to what would be equivalent to atmospheric concentrations of CO2 of 1000ppm (we’re currently at about 420ppm and projected to reach ~500-600ppm by 2050).\nSo treatments should be environmentally relevant. BUT, the increasing prevalence of extreme weather events means that you may want to consider some extreme scenarios, e.g. for heatwaves. In some fields not enough experiments consider the impacts of extreme events.

    "text": "Just quickly, below I’ll refer to:\n‘Experiments’ as manipulative experiments in the lab or field. Field studies in particular may also have some elements of ‘Observational’ studies, so there is a grey-area with:\n‘Observational studies’ as field studies that sample across gradients of natural variation to try and identify effects on a response variable (AKA mensurative experiments).\n‘Environmental gradients’ as gradients in a covariate of interest, e.g. rainfall or fishing pressure. These can occur naturally in the field, or be the result of manipulation in an experiment.\n‘Samples’ are the units of observation.\n‘Response’ is the variable(s) of interest that you hypothesize are affected by the treatments and/or covariates.\n‘Covariates’, ‘predictors’ or ‘explanatory’ variables are the hypothesized drivers of changes in the response. Usually we’d use predictor or explanatory variable in the case of a manipulative experiment, whereas any term is fine in the case of an observational study.\n‘Confounded’ means that you cannot distinguish the effects of two predictors. In a field observational study we could say that two covariates are ‘collinear’.\nAll of the experimental design concepts below also apply to analysis of field surveys or pre-existing datasets (e.g. citizen science data or meta-analyses). In these cases you are limited in the pre-existing ‘treatments’ available to you, so you will need to constrain your interpretation based on experimental design principles."

    "text": "Undoubtedly things will fail. Plants die when they’re not meant to, you can’t visit a site because of a suspicious landholder, your volunteer stuffs up a bunch of measurements, someone turns the power off in the lab… There’s a long list of reasons that your design won’t turn out like you planned.\nSo make sure your design is robust to the loss of some of your samples.\n\n\n\nIdeally you’ll have relatively equal sampling intensities across different treatment levels, or along an environmental gradient of interest (but see below).\nIn the old days having equal sample sizes for each treatment level, a ‘balanced design’ was critical for straightforward stats (e.g. with Type I ANOVA). This rule isn’t so strict with modern GLMs and extensions.\nHowever, it is still important to have sufficient sampling across a gradient or levels of a treatment. You need this to be able to estimate the treatment’s effect relative to background variation.\nIts usually straightforward in laboratory experiments to have equal sample sizes of each treatment level. In observational studies, balancing sampling can be more challenging.\nA common issue is insufficient sampling at all combinations of environmental gradients. As an example, I’ve often worked on analyses of how pollution and fishing pressure affect coastal fish abundance. Unfortunately, these gradients are highly confounded: polluted sites are nearer the coast and tend also to have higher fishing pressure. This means it is impossible to separate the effects of pollution and fishing pressure on fish abundance.\nAn improved observational design would include sites with low pollution and high fishing pressure and vice-versa (if they exist). This would enable us to statistically separate the effects of pollution and fishing, as well as estimate their interaction.\n\n\n\n“Stratify experiments with respect to your knowledge and randomise with respect to your ignorance” - Professor Alan T. James, via Bill Venables.\nYou have two broad options for dealing with background variation. You can try and control them, so they are constant across all samples. For instance, in an experiment you may keep temperature constant, so you can examine the effects of nutrients on algal growth.\nControlled designs have greater power to detect changes of interest. However, they are less general (the results of the algae experiment above only applies at one temperature) and more susceptible to overestimating the effect of a covariate.\nAn alternative option is to randomize your sampling with respect to background sources of variation. Such a design will have reduced power compared to a controlled design, but the effect sizes you estimate will be more general and realistic (typically they are smaller).\nIf you go with randomisation you may want to try increase replication, to address power issues.\n\n\n\nRandom sampling is the basic assumption underlying most stats tests.\nWatch out for sample selection methods that masquerade as random sampling. Ad-hoc sampling, like throwing a quadrat around the intertidal zone, can result in biased inferences.\nFor instance, in a mangrove forest you’d have to be careful to sample both sparse and dense patches of forest. Identifying sample locations beforehand with randomly picked GPS points is one way to address this.\nAnother example is citizen science data, which tends to be heavily biased by accessibility of sites.\nStats can help overcome non-random sampling - you can control statistically for non-random designs if you have some idea of the drivers of sampling (like distance to cities for citsci). But you’ll need to know the drivers well enough to model them.\n\n\n\nPsuedo-replication means your samples aren’t truly independent. The classic example is a design of fish in tanks. If you have 10 tanks and 5 fish in each tank, your replicates are tanks, fish in tanks are psuedo-reps (because they share the same water).\nThis issue can be hidden. For instance, climate change tank experiments often have a single water circulation system per treatment level (e.g. controlling OA or temperature). This means all the replicate tanks on the same system aren’t truly independent samples. Solutions are to have one circulation system per treatment (but expensive!) or run the experiment multiple times to get temporally independent samples.\nIf you have psuedo-replication its not the end of the world. Mixed effects models (e.g. with lme4) are how you model that.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve identified psuedo-replication you may want to use a blocking design to deal with the issue.\nFor example, say you are applying different nutrient and temperature treatments to see how it affects algae growth. You can only grow 10 samples of algae per week and your target is 50 samples. So you will run the experiment over 5 weeks, doing 10 samples per week.\nIdeally, you will want to run every nutrient and temperature treatment every week, so you can separate the effect of ‘week’ from your treatment effects.\nBut say you only have one incubation chamber for maintaining a constant temperature. So each week can only be one temperature. Then you’ll want to either: run the same temperature over multiple weeks or, run a gradient of temperatures (see below). Within each week you will still run every nutrient level. You will also want to randomize the order that the temperature treatments are applied.\nThis will ensure you can estimate the temperature effect and how it applies across different nutrient levels. Multiple samples across weeks will let you remove (statistically) that nuisance variable.\n\n\n\nEasy answer: maximize replication over measuring ‘everything’ at each sample.\nInitial plans I see from students, especially for field designs, often involve measuring a lot of variables at very few sites. But, such designs end up with have low power and a lot of confounded variables, because you end up with more covariates to test than samples to test them.\nYou have a better chance of getting a useful and interesting result if you focus on just a few major patterns. Then you can sample more sites and get replication numbers up.\nAs an example, imagine you can sample 3 sites per day to do rapid assessments of insect taxa diversity and forest structure, or take 2 days to make a detailed assessment of a single site, including document all plant and insect species. The rapid assessment could get you to 42 sites over 3 weeks, versus only 7 sites for the detailed assessment. 42 sites is getting up towards a sample size that is useful for regression modelling (e.g. with glm), whereas 7 is far from enough.\nOf course the replication level you need depends on how variable the system is, but in my (marine fish biased) experience of analyzing ecological field experiments, ~50 independent sites is usually a minimum.\nI’ll add that if you can easily sample more covariates, go for it. You may want to condition on them to statistically control for them when you do the analysis.\n\n\n\nDeveloping a conceptual model of your system, through talking with experts and reading the literature, can help you identify key predictors and refine your research question. This means you can better target your sampling design.\n\n\n\nClosely related to the above idea, I often see students intensely replicating their designs at very few sites (e.g. doing many days of sampling at a single site, or numerous transects per site). But these are psuedoreps. Your study will be more general if you can cover more sites with less replication at each site.\nAiming for greater replication can also help you obtain a deeper understanding of your study topic. You’ll see more different circumstances which may help you formulate better hypotheses.\n\n\n\nEasy answer: gradient designs are better for prediction, and designing for prediction is the future of ecology.\nBut, replicated designs have more power to detect monotonically increasing responses to the predictor.\nSay we are doing an experiment measuring how fast algae grow in flasks under different nutrient levels. We can fit 30 flasks in the lab. Here’s three ways to assign them to nutrient levels: Gradient (every flask gets a different nutrient level), replicated (just two nutrient levels), or hybrid of gradient and replicated.\n What should you do?\nThe replicated design is more typical of ecological experiments. This design gives you the greatest power to detect an effect of nutrients on algae growth (meaning best chance to find p&lt;0.05 if there is an effect).\nReplicated designs may also be preferred for practical reasons, for instance, it may be expensive or time consuming to have multiple levels of the treatment (e.g. requiring multiple different incubators in a warming experiment).\nBUT, there’s a catch. What if your ecological response shows a humped or saturating relationship with the predictor variable? Then your replicated design implies a straight-line relationship between the two levels, e.g. here are results of a gradient vs replicated design for a curved relationship:\n\nSo your ability to predict the ecological response is very poor with the replicated design.\nThis studies provides a series of analyses with simulated and real data to compare our ability to predict with different designs.\nThe above graph assumes you at equal intervals along the gradient. If you know there are regions of rapid change in your response, you could intensify your sampling around those regions.\nHybrid designs are a compromise on prediction and power and may work well in many cases.\nEcology desperately needs to become more ‘predictive’ for a whole heap of reasons, including being able to inform ecosystem management, predict effects of multiple stressors, and for testing fundamental theories. So I encourage you to consider a gradient or hybrid design.\nWhen designing a gradient, look out for high leverage points, e.g. one temperature extreme 5 degrees greater than any of your other treatments/surveys (with no replication) will have a high influence on your fitted model.\n\n\n\nThe classic example is early ocean acidification experiments that acidified water in experimental treatments to what would be equivalent to atmospheric concentrations of CO2 of 1000ppm (we’re currently at about 420ppm and projected to reach ~500-600ppm by 2050).\nSo treatments should be environmentally relevant. BUT, the increasing prevalence of extreme weather events means that you may want to consider some extreme scenarios, e.g. for heatwaves. In some fields not enough experiments consider the impacts of extreme events. For instance, a gradient design could consider both contemporary as well as projected mid-range and extremes values of the predictor.\n\n\n\nI often hear from students questions like ‘this might be a dumb question but, why do we always do 3 transects per site?’.\nDumb questions are great because they reveal tacit knowledge of experts and hidden assumptions. And sometimes they reveal important assumptions that could overturn or invalidate a study’s findings. Like the emperors new clothes.\nSo don’t be afraid to ask ‘dumb’ questions about experimental design."

    "text": "Introduction\n\n\nWhat is data wrangling?Wikipedia defines it as “Data wrangling or data wrangling is loosely the process of manually converting or mapping data from one ‘raw’ form into another format that allows for more convenient consumption of the data with the help of semi-automated tools”. Have you ever been faced with a dataset that was in the wrong format for the statistical package you wanted to use? Well data-wrangling is about solving that problem.If you have ever had to deal with large data-sets you may realise that data wrangling can take a considerable amount of time and skill with spreasheets programs like excel. Data wrangling is also dangerous for your analysis- if you stuff something up, like accidentally deleting some rows of data, it can affect all your results and the problem can be hard to detect.\n\n\n\nThere are better ways of wrangling data than with spreadsheets, and one way is with R.\n\n\nR is fast becoming the most powerful and flexible programming package for environmental data analysis. It is also totally free. R is a powerful language for data wrangling because1. It is relatively fast to process commands2. You can create repeatable scripts3. You can trace errors back to their source3. You can share your wrangling scripts with other people4. You can conveniently search large databases for errors5. Having your data in R opens up a huge array of cutting edge analysis tools.\n\n\nA core principle of science is repeatability. Creating and sharing your wrangling scripts helps you to fulfil the important principle of repeatability. It makes you a better scientist and can also make you a more popular scientist: a well thought out script for a common wrangling problem may be widely used by others. In fact, these days it is best practice to include your scripts with publications.Most statistical methods in R require your data is input in a certain ‘tidy’ format. This course will cover how to use R to easily convert your data into a ‘tidy’ format. Steps include restructuring existing datasets and combining different data-sets. We will also create some data summaries and plots, which are easy once you have ‘tidy’ data. The course will be useful for people who want to explore, analyse and visualise their own field and experimental data in R. The skills covered are also a useful precusor for management of very large datasets in R.\n\n\n\n\nThe main principles I hope you will learn are\n\n\n\nData wrangling in R is safe, fast, reliable and repeatable\n\n\nCoding aesthetics for readable and repeatable code\n\n\n\nTo download the data you need click here\n\n\nThe download also includes a portable html of this course.\n\n\nLet’s begin!"

R is a programming language, which means there are very few commands available in the menus, rather you have to type in commands into the ‘Console’ (notice there is a window called ‘Console’). The hard part about learning to use R is knowning what the commands are that you want and how to structure the commands in a way R understands. RStudio does however, ease the transition to programming by providing you with some drop down menus.Let’s get started with R, doing some basic calculations in the console. In the console type\n\n10 - 1\n\nAnd the console returns an answer (9). You have just asked the R program to compute this (easy) sum. Look carefully at the console and note that each line starts with a &gt; this means the console is ready to take input. If you just type 10 - and hit enter, you will see the next line begins with a +, meaning the console is waiting for you to finish this equation. Type any number and hit return and you will get the answer followed by a &gt;.You can also ask the console for help, for instance try:\n\nhelp('+')\n\nNotice a new ‘Help’ window opens up, with details of how to use arithmetic operators in R. These help files are very useful, but also tend to contain a lot of technical jargon. In learning to use R, you will begin to understand this jargon, making it much easier for you to learn more in the future. But to start off, if things don’t make sense at first reading, try web searches, referring to a beginners book or just experiment with code in different ways to see what happens.R contains most functions and constants for maths you can think of, for instance try:\n\nsqrt(9)\n3^2\nexp(1)\npi"

Try typing this into your console:\n\nx &lt;- 3^2\n\nNote that the console returns absolutely nothing, but it is ready for more input (&gt;). Try typing x and the console reminds us that three squared in fact equals 9. To run through it point by point, the command we are giving says: compute 3^2 and assign (the assign command is this &lt;-) the answer to x. The spaces around the assign don’t matter, you can leave them out. However, I prefer to have the spaces because it makes the code more readable. You may also see some people use = instead of &lt;-. Both are ok, but for technical reasons that will be explained later, it is better to use &lt;- for assigning values to variables.If we want R to return the answer when the calculation is computed then enclose the sum in brackets like this (x &lt;- 3^2).Now, what if we try to recall a variable that does not exist? For instance type y. R reminds us, in red font, that we never created a variable called y.Now we have created x we can use it in algebraic equations. For instance try z &lt;- x*3 and you will see we get variable z that equals 27.We can also assign words to variables:\n\nv &lt;- 'today'\n\nNote that we enclosed our word in inverted commas. If we didn’t do this, R would try to assign the value of the variable today to v.A few tips on naming variables. You can name variables whatever you want (e.g. you could use nine instead of x), but there are a few rules: (1) you can’t use special characters in variable names (other than . and _) and (2) you must start a variable name with a letter. It is also a good idea to avoid naming variables as constants or functions that already exist in R, like pi, e, help."

    "text": "Scripts\n\n\nSo far we have just been typing everything into the console. However, we might want to save our commands for later. To do this go to the menu and select file -&gt; New file -&gt; R Script. It will open a text editor. From now on, type all your code into this editor. To send the code to the console, click on a line, or select a section and hit ctrl-R on windows or cmnd-enter on mac.We can put comments in the script, to remind us what it does. R will not evaluate comments, which are preceeded by an #. For instance, start your script by typing:\n\n# R data wrangling course\n# Your name\n# 23 Jun 2015\n\nI recommend using comments frequently throughout your code. It will make life a lot easier when you come back to a piece of code after a few days, because the comments will remind you what the code does. It will also make it easier to share your code with collaborators and make your code more repeatable, which as I said, is a core principle of science. Another way to make your code more readable is to break up sections of code within your script, for instance here is how I often delineate sections in my code\n\n#-----------------------#\n#   MAJOR HEADING     #\n#-----------------------#\n\n#\n# Minor heading\n#\n\nNow we have a script with something worth saving, you should go to the menu and select ‘file’ -&gt; ‘save as’ to save the script for later. Next time you come back to your analysis, you can just open this file, select everything and hit run. Then you will be back to where you left off last time. Further, you can share your script with other people or publish it with your paper.Don’t forget what I said about repeatability and readability! It can take time to organise your script carefully, but it is worth it. I encourage you to include ample comments and section headers as we progress with the rest of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nReading in data\n\n\nR really becomes useful when we can read in our own datasets. To start, we are going to read in a dataset of fish surveys, dat.csv. This is a practice data set and is very small (only 21 rows). You might think wrangling this data would be easier in a spreadsheet, like excel. We will develop our wrangling skills on this small dataset then test them on a much larger dataset, which would be tricky to handle in a spreadsheet.The first step is to tell R where on your computer the dataset is stored. In your script type this (but replace the path with that for your own computer)\n\n#\n#DATA IMPORT\n#\nsetwd('/Users/Documents/R data wrangling')\n\nsetwd() stands for ‘set working directory’. You will need to replace the folder path in the ’‘ with the path on your computer. On windows you can right click on the file and select ‘properties’, on mac use ‘get info’, then cut and paste the path. Note that if you cut and paste on a windows computer you will have to replace the &lt;/code&gt; with /. I also have put a code header in here as an example. I won’t do this below, but I suggest you put in code headers for each new section we cover, it will make it easier for you to come back to this script later.We can see the files in this folder by typing list.files(). The first data we will use is called dat.csv and can be read in as a dataframe like this\n\nfishdat &lt;- read.csv('dat.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\nNotice we used the assign operator again, but this time assigned the input data to the name fishdat.read.csv is function that reads a csv file and stores it in R’s local memory. Functions are simply algorithms that R has stored, which perform a task for you, in this case reading a csv file. Functions always begin with a name followed by (), which contain some arguments. In the case of the read.csv() function, the arguments are the name of the data file (‘dat.csv’), header = TRUE and stringsAsFactors = FALSE. The header argument simply says the first row is a row of variable names (so don’t treat them as measurements). The strings as factors arguments tells R to treat strings (ie words) as strings and not to group them by names. You will see why we do this later. Also notice we use = to specify the function’s arguments. As I said above, it is best to use &lt;- for assigning variable names and save = for function arguments.If you need more help on any function in R type its name prefixed with a question mark, for instance ?read.csv.Now lets look at fishdat. Either type fishdat into the console, or on RStudio, go to the Environment window and double click on ‘fishdat’ under ‘Data’. You will see a table of data like this (I have appended a truncated version here)\n\n\nfishdat is what we call ‘tidy data’. Each row is an observation. Here we have multiple sites, each with five transects. We have five variables site, the names of sites, transect the transect number, fish_abund the abundance of fish at that transect and dN15_SG the ratio of nitrogen stable isotopes of a seagrass sample from that transect (high nitrogen isotope values indicate the influence of pollution).\n\n\n\n\nA note about Excel files\n\n\nIn short, don’t use .xlsx or .xls files for saving data. The problem with .xls and .xlsx files are that they store extra info with the data that makes files larger than neccessary and Excel formats can also unwittingly alter your data!This kind of thing can really mess you up. A stable way to save your data is as a .csv which stands for comma seperated values. These are simply values seperated by commas and rows defined by returns. If you select ‘save as’ in excel, you can choose .csv as one of the options. Try opening the .csv file I have given you using a text editor and you will see it is just words, numbers and commas. Obviously using the csv format means you need to avoid commas in your variable names and values, because all commas will be interpreted as spaces between cells in the table.As an example of the problems with excel files, type some numbers into an excel spreadsheet then click ‘format’ -&gt; ‘cells’ and change the category to ‘time’. Now save it as a .csv and open it with a text editor. Your numbers have changed from what you typed in. Because excel automatically detects number types, if you enter something that looks like dates it might decide to change them all to dates and in doing so alter your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing variables in the dataframe\n\n\nThe rules we learned above for accessing values of a variable also apply to dataframes. Except now we have both rows and columns. Rows and columns are indexed by using a comma as a separator. Try\n\nfishdat[1,3]\nfishdat[,2]\nfishdat[1,]\nfishdat[ ,c(1,3)]\n\nWe can also access variables by their names:\n\nfishdat$site\nfishdat$fish_abund[1:5]\nfishdat[,'transect']\n\n\n\nBasic data summaries\n\n\nWe can get a summary of the data frame by typing:\n\nhead(fishdat) #first 6 rows by default\nhead(fishdat, 10) #first ten rows\n\nUseful if the dataframe is very large!We can also do some statistical summaries. This is handy to check the data is ready in correctly and even to start some analysis. For instance:\n\nnrow(fishdat)\nmean(fishdat$fish_abund)\nsd(fishdat$fish_abund) #standard deviation of abundances\ntable(fishdat$site) #number of transects per site\ntable(fishdat$transect) #number of sites per transect\n\nDid you notice a mistake in fishdat?Yes, R distinguishes between upper and low case, so it is treating sites b and B as different sites. They are meant to be the same. We will find out how to correct this typo in a moment. But first, we need to locate its position.We can locate the indices for certain variables using logical relations, for instance\n\nfishdat$site == 'A'\n\nReturns a vector of TRUE and FALSE, with the same number of rows as the dataframe. TRUE occures where the site is A and FALSE where the site isn’t A. The double equals above is used to ask a question (ie is site A?). If you prefer row indices to T/F, you can enclose the logicals in the which() function:\n\nwhich(fishdat$site == 'A')\n\nSo the first five rows are site A. There are other sorts of logical quesions for instance:\n\nwhich(fishdat$site !='A')\nwhich(fishdat$dN15_SG &gt; 11.99)\nwhich(fishdat$dN15_SG &gt;= 11.99)\n\n\n\nCorrecting mistakes in data frames\n\n\nEarlier we noticed a typo where one transect at site ‘B’ was mistakenly typed as site ‘b’. We should identify which ‘b’ is wrong and correct it.\n\nierror &lt;- which(fishdat$site == 'b') #Find out which row number is wrong\nfishdat$site[ierror]\nfishdat$site[ierror] &lt;- 'B' #Change it to the correct upper case. \n\nWe could also have used the toupper() function to change the case of ‘b’ (or infact the case of every value in site. You might be thinking, ‘I could have easily changed that error in a spreasheet’. Well you could have for a dataframe with 20 observations, but what if the data had 1 million observations?## Saving our corrected data frame Now we have corrected our dataframe, we may want to save it for later. We can do this with write.csv() which is basically the opposite of `read.csv()\n\nwrite.csv(fishdat, 'dat_corrected.csv', row.names = FALSE)\n\nWhich saves a new csv file to our current working directory (have a look in your folder and you should see it there). If you want to know what your current working directory is, type getwd().\n\n\n\n\nBasic plots\n\n\nLets do a few graphical summaries. Try these\n\nhist(fishdat$fish_abund)\nplot(fishdat$fish_abund, fishdat$dN15_SG)\n\nWhich plots a histogram and an xy plot of fish abundances against the nitrogen isotope ratios for seagrass at each transect. Looks like there is a relationship. We can improve our plot slightly by using some extra arguments to plot()\n\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abundance', pch = 15)\n\n\n\n\nThe pch command changes the symbol type. In fact, a whole host of graphical parameters are available with the par() function (try ?par to see them all). For instance\n\npar(las=1) #plot text the right way up\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abundance', pch = 15)\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,2)) #plot window with two columns \nhist(fishdat$fish_abund, xlab ='Fish abundance', main ='Histogram')\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abundance', pch = 15, col ='steelblue')\n\n\n\nLoading packages\n\n\nMany users of R also develop add on packages, which they then share with the world. Today we are going to use some packages that make data wrangling easy. First you need to install them to your computer (you will need a web connection to do this). I will run through package installs on the projector. Today we need the tidyr (for tidying dataframes) and dplyr (‘data pliers’) packages. Once you have installed these, you need to load them for each new R session like this:\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nThe red warning just means some functions in R’s base packages have been replaced with those in dplyr, nothing for us to worry about here.All the operations we will perform in tidyr and dplyr can be done using R’s base packages. However, we are using these special packages because they make data wrangling easy, intuitive and aesthetic. Remember I said that a good script can make you a popular scientist? Well dplyr and tidyr are good examples of that. They do some tasks we could do already in R but makes them easier and faster.\n\n\n\n\nFiltering a dataframe using dplyr\n\n\nWe can filter a dataframe with dplyr to say, just get the rows for one site\n\nfish_A &lt;- filter(fishdat, site == 'A')\nfish_A\n\nWhich says, take the fishdat dataframe and filter it for rows that have site==‘A’. One way this could be useful would be to help us make a plot where the sites are different colours, for instance\n\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abunance', pch = 15, col ='grey')\npoints(fish_A$dN15_SG, fish_A$fish_abund, pch = 15, col = 'red')\n\n\n\n\nHere we have plotted all the points (an easy way to get the axes to scale correctly) and then used points() to add points for site A, but changed their colours. Can you work out how to add the other three sites as different colours?\n\n\n\n\nSummaries using dplyr\n\n\nSummarising data is straightforward with dplyr. What follows is somewhat similar to making a pivot table in excel, but without all the clicking. First we need to specify what we are summarising over, using the group_by() function\n\ngrps &lt;- group_by(fishdat, site)\ngrps\n\ngrps is similar to the orginal data frame, but an extra property has been added ‘Groups:site’. Now we have specified a grouping variable, we can summarise() by sites, for instance the mean values of the nitrogen isotopes and fish abundances\n\nsummarise(grps, mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG)) #just nitrogen\nsummarise(grps, mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG), mean_abund = mean(fish_abund)) #means for nitrogen and fish\n\nHere is what our data summary looks like\n\n## Source: local data frame [4 x 3]\n##\n##   site mean_dN mean_abund\n## 1    A   9.666        6.4\n## 2    B  15.260       18.6\n## 3    C  10.878        4.2\n## 4    D  14.752       19.6\n\nYou could summarise using all sorts of other functions, like sd() or min(). Try it for yourself.Let’s store our new data summary then, use its variables in some plots\n\ndatsum &lt;- summarise(grps, mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG), mean_abund = mean(fish_abund))\n#Make a plot with all variables\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abundance', pch = 15)\n#Add the means summaries as red points\npoints(datsum$mean_dN, datsum$mean_abund, pch = 16, col ='red')\n\n\n\nAesthetics in multi-line coding\n\n\nNotice that we just did a series of data-wrangling steps. First we identified groups then we created some summaries. We could write this code all on one line like this\n\nsummarise(group_by(fishdat, site), mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG))\n\nWhich will return the same summary as above. But, notice we have nested a function inside a function! Not very aesthetic and difficult for others to follow. One solution would be to do the code over multiple lines, like we did above\n\ngrps &lt;- group_by(fishdat, site)\nsummarise(grps, mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG))\n\nOne clever thing that the creaters of dplyr did was to add data ‘pipes’ to improve the aesthetics of multi-function commands. Pipes look like this %&gt;% and work like this\n\nfishdat %&gt;% group_by(site) %&gt;% summarise(mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG))\n\nPipes take the output of the first function and apply it as the first argument of the second function and so on. Notice that we skip specifying the dataframe in group_by() and summarise() because the data was specified at the start of the pipe. The pipe is like saying, take fishdat pipe it into group_by(), then pipe the result into summarise(). Now our code reads like a sentence ‘take fishdat, do this, then this, then this’. Rather than before which was more like ‘apply this function to the output of another function that was applied to fishdat’.\n\n\n\n\nJoining dataframes\n\n\nOur fish abundances and seagrass isotopes aren’t the end point of our data analysis. We also want to know how they relate to some variables we measured at each site. To see these load\n\nsitedat &lt;- read.csv('Sitesdat.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nsitedat\n\ndplyr has a range of functions for joining dataframes. All are prefixed with join. Here we use the inner_join() to find out about the others look at the help file (?inner_join)\n\ndatnew &lt;- inner_join(fishdat, sitedat, by ='site')\ndatnew\n\nWe have joined fishdat and sitedat by their common variable site. Notice the join automatically replicates distance and depth across all the transects, keeping out dataframe ‘tidy’. One analysis we could do is plot the seagrass isotope ratios by distance (which represents distance from a sewage plant).\n\nplot(datnew$distance, datnew$dN15_SG, xlab ='Distance from sewage', ylab ='Nitrogen isotope ratio of seagrass')\n\n\n\n\nLooks like the pollution source is enriching the nitrogen in the seagrass.As a challenge, can you think of a way of plotting the mean values of dN15_SG at each distance?\n\n\n\n\nTidying messy data\n\n\nWe have yet more data. Our collaborator has helped us out and taken three fish of different sizes from each site (small, medium and large) and run isotope analyses on those. This is great, because it means we can see if fish isotopes follow the same pattern as the seagrass.Let’s look at the data\n\nfishiso &lt;- read.csv('FishIsodat.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nfishiso\n\nIt seems our collaborator was not familiar with the ‘tidy data’ format. Notice that values for the isotope ratios at each site are stored as separate columns. We will need to tidy this data if we are to proceed. Luckily we have the tidyr() package handy and one function gather() will be particularly handy here. Check out the vignettes other useful functions to tidy data)\n\n(isotidy &lt;- gather(fishiso, site, dN_fish, A:D))\n##      size site dN_fish\n## 1   small    A   10.04\n## 2  medium    A   11.21\n## 3   large    A   10.77\n## 4   small    B   16.10\n## 5  medium    B      NA\n## 6   large    B   16.50\n## 7   small    C   12.23\n## 8  medium    C   13.18\n## 9   large    C   13.20\n## 10  small    D   14.93\n## 11 medium    D   14.44\n## 12  large    D   13.98\n\nThe tidy data looks much better. What gather() has done is take the fishiso dataframe, creating new variables site and dN_fish and made them from the values in columns A to D.Notice the NA for the medium fish at site B. Unfortunately, we couldn’t catch a fish of that size at site B. We have encoded the missing value as NA when we entered the data. NA is the correct way to indicate a missing value to R.\n\n\n\n\nSummaries with missing values\n\n\nLet’s create a summary of our new fish isotope ratio data, using our new piping skills.\n\n(fishiso_mn &lt;- isotidy %&gt;% group_by(size) %&gt;% summarise(mean_dN = mean(dN_fish)))\n## Source: local data frame [3 x 2]\n##\n##     size mean_dN\n## 1  large 13.6125\n## 2 medium      NA\n## 3  small 13.3250\n\nWhich says, take isotidy, group it by size then make a summary of mean values for dN_fish. Well we get the means, but not for the size category with the missing value. Why? R’s default setting for taking a mean across a vector with a missing value is the return NA. R does this to make sure we are aware there are missing samples (and therefore, our design is unbalanced). We can change this default behaviour however, and ask R to ignore the NA by adding the argument na.rm = TRUE\n\n(fishiso_mn &lt;- isotidy %&gt;% group_by(size) %&gt;% summarise(mean_dN = mean(dN_fish, na.rm = TRUE)))\n## Source: local data frame [3 x 2]\n##\n##     size  mean_dN\n## 1  large 13.61250\n## 2 medium 12.94333\n## 3  small 13.32500\n\nWe have our mean for the medium fish, but be aware, it was taken from only three sites. Let’s also do some means by sites (across sizes)\n\nsites_iso_mn &lt;- isotidy %&gt;% group_by(site) %&gt;% summarise(mean_dNfish = mean(dN_fish, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\nBringing it all together\n\n\nNow we have combined all our data frames, let’s see if we can plot nitrogen isotope ratios for both fish and seagrass on the same plot, as a function of distance from the sewage plant. First, join the mean values for fish isotope ratios to the site data\n\nsites_means &lt;- inner_join(sitedat, sites_iso_mn, by = 'site')\n\nThen join our new sites dataframe with the summary of fishdat.\n\n(sites_means2 &lt;- inner_join(sites_means, datsum, by = 'site'))\n##   site distance depth mean_dNfish mean_dN mean_abund\n## 1    A        5    10    10.67333   9.666        6.4\n## 2    B       12    11    16.30000  15.260       18.6\n## 3    C        6     4    12.87000  10.878        4.2\n## 4    D       11     3    14.45000  14.752       19.6\n\nNote, you could try doing this all in one line, using pipes.Now lets put it all together in a plot\n\npar(las = 1)\nplot(sites_means2$distance, sites_means2$mean_dN, xlab = 'Distance from sewage plant', ylab = 'N isotope ratio', pch = 16, ylim = c(5, 20), col = 'springgreen3', cex = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.3)\npoints(sites_means2$distance, sites_means2$mean_dNfish, xlab = 'Distance from sewage plant',  ylab = 'N isotope ratio', pch = 16, col ='steelblue1', cex = 1.5)\nlegend('topleft', legend = c('Seagrass', 'Fish'), pch = 16, col =c('springgreen3','steelblue1'), cex = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\nTo explain some new arguments above, ylim sets the y-limits, cex sets the scaling of points and cex.lab resizes the axes labels. The legend() function lets us add a legend to the plot. Note, if you want to try different colours, type colors() to see a full list. The RColorBrewer package is also extremely handy for picking colours. Finally, you should also plot the correlation of mean fish versus mean seagrass isotope ratios. I will leave that to you to work out.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced tasks\n\n\nIf you have cruised through the first part of the course, have a go with this advanced challenge question. I have given you some extra dataframes to practice your data wrangling skills with. These are much larger, so you will need to use R to find errors in them. The dataframes are: Fish_wghts.csv which records individual weights and sexes for fish caught in 100 different trawls; and Trawl_sites.csv which records for each trawl: its distance from shore and its depth. We want to know how the mean weight of individual fish varies with distance from shore, how the total population biomass varies with distance from shore and if the the different sexes have different weights. Beware: there are two errors in the fish_wghts file that you will need to correct!\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nI hope I have convinced you of how useful R can be for data wrangling. R might be hard at first, but the more you use R the easier it will become. If you can use R you will find data management much more straightforward and repeatable. Aim to write aesthetic scripts and you can avoid many head-aches when you realise there are errors in your database- with a neat script you can trace back to the problem and correct it.Data wrangling is a skill that take times to learn. But I believe it is worthwhile. Being good at data wrangling will make you a sought after collaborator and a better scientist."

    "section": "\nReading in data\n",
    "text": "Reading in data\n\n\nR really becomes useful when we can read in our own datasets. To start, we are going to read in a dataset of fish surveys, dat.csv. This is a practice data set and is very small (only 21 rows). You might think wrangling this data would be easier in a spreadsheet, like excel. We will develop our wrangling skills on this small dataset then test them on a much larger dataset, which would be tricky to handle in a spreadsheet.The first step is to tell R where on your computer the dataset is stored. In your script type this (but replace the path with that for your own computer)\n\n#\n#DATA IMPORT\n#\nsetwd('/Users/Documents/R data wrangling')\n\nsetwd() stands for ‘set working directory’. You will need to replace the folder path in the ’‘ with the path on your computer. On windows you can right click on the file and select ‘properties’, on mac use ‘get info’, then cut and paste the path. Note that if you cut and paste on a windows computer you will have to replace the &lt;/code&gt; with /. I also have put a code header in here as an example. I won’t do this below, but I suggest you put in code headers for each new section we cover, it will make it easier for you to come back to this script later.We can see the files in this folder by typing list.files(). The first data we will use is called dat.csv and can be read in as a dataframe like this\n\nfishdat &lt;- read.csv('dat.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\nNotice we used the assign operator again, but this time assigned the input data to the name fishdat.read.csv is function that reads a csv file and stores it in R’s local memory. Functions are simply algorithms that R has stored, which perform a task for you, in this case reading a csv file. Functions always begin with a name followed by (), which contain some arguments. In the case of the read.csv() function, the arguments are the name of the data file (‘dat.csv’), header = TRUE and stringsAsFactors = FALSE. The header argument simply says the first row is a row of variable names (so don’t treat them as measurements). The strings as factors arguments tells R to treat strings (ie words) as strings and not to group them by names. You will see why we do this later. Also notice we use = to specify the function’s arguments. As I said above, it is best to use &lt;- for assigning variable names and save = for function arguments.If you need more help on any function in R type its name prefixed with a question mark, for instance ?read.csv.Now lets look at fishdat. Either type fishdat into the console, or on RStudio, go to the Environment window and double click on ‘fishdat’ under ‘Data’. You will see a table of data like this (I have appended a truncated version here)\n\n\nfishdat is what we call ‘tidy data’. Each row is an observation. Here we have multiple sites, each with five transects. We have five variables site, the names of sites, transect the transect number, fish_abund the abundance of fish at that transect and dN15_SG the ratio of nitrogen stable isotopes of a seagrass sample from that transect (high nitrogen isotope values indicate the influence of pollution).\n\n\n\n\nA note about Excel files\n\n\nIn short, don’t use .xlsx or .xls files for saving data. The problem with .xls and .xlsx files are that they store extra info with the data that makes files larger than neccessary and Excel formats can also unwittingly alter your data!This kind of thing can really mess you up. A stable way to save your data is as a .csv which stands for comma seperated values. These are simply values seperated by commas and rows defined by returns. If you select ‘save as’ in excel, you can choose .csv as one of the options. Try opening the .csv file I have given you using a text editor and you will see it is just words, numbers and commas. Obviously using the csv format means you need to avoid commas in your variable names and values, because all commas will be interpreted as spaces between cells in the table.As an example of the problems with excel files, type some numbers into an excel spreadsheet then click ‘format’ -&gt; ‘cells’ and change the category to ‘time’. Now save it as a .csv and open it with a text editor. Your numbers have changed from what you typed in. Because excel automatically detects number types, if you enter something that looks like dates it might decide to change them all to dates and in doing so alter your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing variables in the dataframe\n\n\nThe rules we learned above for accessing values of a variable also apply to dataframes. Except now we have both rows and columns. Rows and columns are indexed by using a comma as a separator. Try\n\nfishdat[1,3]\nfishdat[,2]\nfishdat[1,]\nfishdat[ ,c(1,3)]\n\nWe can also access variables by their names:\n\nfishdat$site\nfishdat$fish_abund[1:5]\nfishdat[,'transect']\n\n\n\nBasic data summaries\n\n\nWe can get a summary of the data frame by typing:\n\nhead(fishdat) #first 6 rows by default\nhead(fishdat, 10) #first ten rows\n\nUseful if the dataframe is very large!We can also do some statistical summaries. This is handy to check the data is ready in correctly and even to start some analysis. For instance:\n\nnrow(fishdat)\nmean(fishdat$fish_abund)\nsd(fishdat$fish_abund) #standard deviation of abundances\ntable(fishdat$site) #number of transects per site\ntable(fishdat$transect) #number of sites per transect\n\nDid you notice a mistake in fishdat?Yes, R distinguishes between upper and low case, so it is treating sites b and B as different sites.

There are other sorts of logical quesions for instance:\n\nwhich(fishdat$site !='A')\nwhich(fishdat$dN15_SG &gt; 11.99)\nwhich(fishdat$dN15_SG &gt;= 11.99)\n\n\n\nCorrecting mistakes in data frames\n\n\nEarlier we noticed a typo where one transect at site ‘B’ was mistakenly typed as site ‘b’. We should identify which ‘b’ is wrong and correct it.\n\nierror &lt;- which(fishdat$site == 'b') #Find out which row number is wrong\nfishdat$site[ierror]\nfishdat$site[ierror] &lt;- 'B' #Change it to the correct upper case. \n\nWe could also have used the toupper() function to change the case of ‘b’ (or infact the case of every value in site. You might be thinking, ‘I could have easily changed that error in a spreasheet’. Well you could have for a dataframe with 20 observations, but what if the data had 1 million observations?## Saving our corrected data frame Now we have corrected our dataframe, we may want to save it for later. We can do this with write.csv() which is basically the opposite of `read.csv()\n\nwrite.csv(fishdat, 'dat_corrected.csv', row.names = FALSE)\n\nWhich saves a new csv file to our current working directory (have a look in your folder and you should see it there). If you want to know what your current working directory is, type getwd().\n\n\n\n\nBasic plots\n\n\nLets do a few graphical summaries. Try these\n\nhist(fishdat$fish_abund)\nplot(fishdat$fish_abund, fishdat$dN15_SG)\n\nWhich plots a histogram and an xy plot of fish abundances against the nitrogen isotope ratios for seagrass at each transect. Looks like there is a relationship. We can improve our plot slightly by using some extra arguments to plot()\n\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abundance', pch = 15)\n\n\n\n\nThe pch command changes the symbol type. In fact, a whole host of graphical parameters are available with the par() function (try ?par to see them all). For instance\n\npar(las=1) #plot text the right way up\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abundance', pch = 15)\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,2)) #plot window with two columns \nhist(fishdat$fish_abund, xlab ='Fish abundance', main ='Histogram')\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abundance', pch = 15, col ='steelblue')\n\n\n\nLoading packages\n\n\nMany users of R also develop add on packages, which they then share with the world.

They do some tasks we could do already in R but makes them easier and faster.\n\n\n\n\nFiltering a dataframe using dplyr\n\n\nWe can filter a dataframe with dplyr to say, just get the rows for one site\n\nfish_A &lt;- filter(fishdat, site == 'A')\nfish_A\n\nWhich says, take the fishdat dataframe and filter it for rows that have site==‘A’. One way this could be useful would be to help us make a plot where the sites are different colours, for instance\n\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abunance', pch = 15, col ='grey')\npoints(fish_A$dN15_SG, fish_A$fish_abund, pch = 15, col = 'red')\n\n\n\n\nHere we have plotted all the points (an easy way to get the axes to scale correctly) and then used points() to add points for site A, but changed their colours. Can you work out how to add the other three sites as different colours?\n\n\n\n\nSummaries using dplyr\n\n\nSummarising data is straightforward with dplyr. What follows is somewhat similar to making a pivot table in excel, but without all the clicking. First we need to specify what we are summarising over, using the group_by() function\n\ngrps &lt;- group_by(fishdat, site)\ngrps\n\ngrps is similar to the orginal data frame, but an extra property has been added ‘Groups:site’. Now we have specified a grouping variable, we can summarise() by sites, for instance the mean values of the nitrogen isotopes and fish abundances\n\nsummarise(grps, mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG)) #just nitrogen\nsummarise(grps, mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG), mean_abund = mean(fish_abund)) #means for nitrogen and fish\n\nHere is what our data summary looks like\n\n## Source: local data frame [4 x 3]\n##\n##   site mean_dN mean_abund\n## 1    A   9.666        6.4\n## 2    B  15.260       18.6\n## 3    C  10.878        4.2\n## 4    D  14.752       19.6\n\nYou could summarise using all sorts of other functions, like sd() or min(). Try it for yourself.Let’s store our new data summary then, use its variables in some plots\n\ndatsum &lt;- summarise(grps, mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG), mean_abund = mean(fish_abund))\n#Make a plot with all variables\nplot(fishdat$dN15_SG, fishdat$fish_abund, xlab = 'N Isotope ratio', ylab ='Fish abundance', pch = 15)\n#Add the means summaries as red points\npoints(datsum$mean_dN, datsum$mean_abund, pch = 16, col ='red')\n\n\n\nAesthetics in multi-line coding\n\n\nNotice that we just did a series of data-wrangling steps. First we identified groups then we created some summaries. We could write this code all on one line like this\n\nsummarise(group_by(fishdat, site), mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG))\n\nWhich will return the same summary as above. But, notice we have nested a function inside a function! Not very aesthetic and difficult for others to follow. One solution would be to do the code over multiple lines, like we did above\n\ngrps &lt;- group_by(fishdat, site)\nsummarise(grps, mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG))\n\nOne clever thing that the creaters of dplyr did was to add data ‘pipes’ to improve the aesthetics of multi-function commands. Pipes look like this %&gt;% and work like this\n\nfishdat %&gt;% group_by(site) %&gt;% summarise(mean_dN = mean(dN15_SG))\n\nPipes take the output of the first function and apply it as the first argument of the second function and so on. Notice that we skip specifying the dataframe in group_by() and summarise() because the data was specified at the start of the pipe. The pipe is like saying, take fishdat pipe it into group_by(), then pipe the result into summarise(). Now our code reads like a sentence ‘take fishdat, do this, then this, then this’. Rather than before which was more like ‘apply this function to the output of another function that was applied to fishdat’.\n\n\n\n\nJoining dataframes\n\n\nOur fish abundances and seagrass isotopes aren’t the end point of our data analysis. We also want to know how they relate to some variables we measured at each site. To see these load\n\nsitedat &lt;- read.csv('Sitesdat.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nsitedat\n\ndplyr has a range of functions for joining dataframes. All are prefixed with join. Here we use the inner_join() to find out about the others look at the help file (?inner_join)\n\ndatnew &lt;- inner_join(fishdat, sitedat, by ='site')\ndatnew\n\nWe have joined fishdat and sitedat by their common variable site. Notice the join automatically replicates distance and depth across all the transects, keeping out dataframe ‘tidy’. One analysis we could do is plot the seagrass isotope ratios by distance (which represents distance from a sewage plant).\n\nplot(datnew$distance, datnew$dN15_SG, xlab ='Distance from sewage', ylab ='Nitrogen isotope ratio of seagrass')\n\n\n\n\nLooks like the pollution source is enriching the nitrogen in the seagrass.As a challenge, can you think of a way of plotting the mean values of dN15_SG at each distance?\n\n\n\n\nTidying messy data\n\n\nWe have yet more data. Our collaborator has helped us out and taken three fish of different sizes from each site (small, medium and large) and run isotope analyses on those. This is great, because it means we can see if fish isotopes follow the same pattern as the seagrass.Let’s look at the data\n\nfishiso &lt;- read.csv('FishIsodat.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nfishiso\n\nIt seems our collaborator was not familiar with the ‘tidy data’ format. Notice that values for the isotope ratios at each site are stored as separate columns. We will need to tidy this data if we are to proceed. Luckily we have the tidyr() package handy and one function gather() will be particularly handy here. Check out the vignettes other useful functions to tidy data)\n\n(isotidy &lt;- gather(fishiso, site, dN_fish, A:D))\n##      size site dN_fish\n## 1   small    A   10.04\n## 2  medium    A   11.21\n## 3   large    A   10.77\n## 4   small    B   16.10\n## 5  medium    B      NA\n## 6   large    B   16.50\n## 7   small    C   12.23\n## 8  medium    C   13.18\n## 9   large    C   13.20\n## 10  small    D   14.93\n## 11 medium    D   14.44\n## 12  large    D   13.98\n\nThe tidy data looks much better. What gather() has done is take the fishiso dataframe, creating new variables site and dN_fish and made them from the values in columns A to D.Notice the NA for the medium fish at site B. Unfortunately, we couldn’t catch a fish of that size at site B. We have encoded the missing value as NA when we entered the data. NA is the correct way to indicate a missing value to R.\n\n\n\n\nSummaries with missing values\n\n\nLet’s create a summary of our new fish isotope ratio data, using our new piping skills.\n\n(fishiso_mn &lt;- isotidy %&gt;% group_by(size) %&gt;% summarise(mean_dN = mean(dN_fish)))\n## Source: local data frame [3 x 2]\n##\n##     size mean_dN\n## 1  large 13.6125\n## 2 medium      NA\n## 3  small 13.3250\n\nWhich says, take isotidy, group it by size then make a summary of mean values for dN_fish. Well we get the means, but not for the size category with the missing value. Why? R’s default setting for taking a mean across a vector with a missing value is the return NA. R does this to make sure we are aware there are missing samples (and therefore, our design is unbalanced). We can change this default behaviour however, and ask R to ignore the NA by adding the argument na.rm = TRUE\n\n(fishiso_mn &lt;- isotidy %&gt;% group_by(size) %&gt;% summarise(mean_dN = mean(dN_fish, na.rm = TRUE)))\n## Source: local data frame [3 x 2]\n##\n##     size  mean_dN\n## 1  large 13.61250\n## 2 medium 12.94333\n## 3  small 13.32500\n\nWe have our mean for the medium fish, but be aware, it was taken from only three sites. Let’s also do some means by sites (across sizes)\n\nsites_iso_mn &lt;- isotidy %&gt;% group_by(site) %&gt;% summarise(mean_dNfish = mean(dN_fish, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\nBringing it all together\n\n\nNow we have combined all our data frames, let’s see if we can plot nitrogen isotope ratios for both fish and seagrass on the same plot, as a function of distance from the sewage plant. First, join the mean values for fish isotope ratios to the site data\n\nsites_means &lt;- inner_join(sitedat, sites_iso_mn, by = 'site')\n\nThen join our new sites dataframe with the summary of fishdat.\n\n(sites_means2 &lt;- inner_join(sites_means, datsum, by = 'site'))\n##   site distance depth mean_dNfish mean_dN mean_abund\n## 1    A        5    10    10.67333   9.666        6.4\n## 2    B       12    11    16.30000  15.260       18.6\n## 3    C        6     4    12.87000  10.878        4.2\n## 4    D       11     3    14.45000  14.752       19.6\n\nNote, you could try doing this all in one line, using pipes.Now lets put it all together in a plot\n\npar(las = 1)\nplot(sites_means2$distance, sites_means2$mean_dN, xlab = 'Distance from sewage plant', ylab = 'N isotope ratio', pch = 16, ylim = c(5, 20), col = 'springgreen3', cex = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.3)\npoints(sites_means2$distance, sites_means2$mean_dNfish, xlab = 'Distance from sewage plant',  ylab = 'N isotope ratio', pch = 16, col ='steelblue1', cex = 1.5)\nlegend('topleft', legend = c('Seagrass', 'Fish'), pch = 16, col =c('springgreen3','steelblue1'), cex = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\nTo explain some new arguments above, ylim sets the y-limits, cex sets the scaling of points and cex.lab resizes the axes labels. The legend() function lets us add a legend to the plot. Note, if you want to try different colours, type colors() to see a full list. The RColorBrewer package is also extremely handy for picking colours. Finally, you should also plot the correlation of mean fish versus mean seagrass isotope ratios. I will leave that to you to work out.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced tasks\n\n\nIf you have cruised through the first part of the course, have a go with this advanced challenge question. I have given you some extra dataframes to practice your data wrangling skills with. These are much larger, so you will need to use R to find errors in them. The dataframes are: Fish_wghts.csv which records individual weights and sexes for fish caught in 100 different trawls; and Trawl_sites.csv which records for each trawl: its distance from shore and its depth. We want to know how the mean weight of individual fish varies with distance from shore, how the total population biomass varies with distance from shore and if the the different sexes have different weights. Beware: there are two errors in the fish_wghts file that you will need to correct!\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nI hope I have convinced you of how useful R can be for data wrangling. R might be hard at first, but the more you use R the easier it will become. If you can use R you will find data management much more straightforward and repeatable. Aim to write aesthetic scripts and you can avoid many head-aches when you realise there are errors in your database- with a neat script you can trace back to the problem and correct it.Data wrangling is a skill that take times to learn. But I believe it is worthwhile. Being good at data wrangling will make you a sought after collaborator and a better scientist."

This is handy to check the data is ready in correctly and even to start some analysis. For instance:\n\nnrow(fishdat)\nmean(fishdat$fish_abund)\nsd(fishdat$fish_abund) #standard deviation of abundances\ntable(fishdat$site) #number of transects per site\ntable(fishdat$transect) #number of sites per transect\n\nDid you notice a mistake in fishdat?Yes, R distinguishes between upper and low case, so it is treating sites b and B as different sites. They are meant to be the same. We will find out how to correct this typo in a moment. But first, we need to locate its position.We can locate the indices for certain variables using logical relations, for instance\n\nfishdat$site == 'A'\n\nReturns a vector of TRUE and FALSE, with the same number of rows as the dataframe. TRUE occures where the site is A and FALSE where the site isn’t A. The double equals above is used to ask a question (ie is site A?). If you prefer row indices to T/F, you can enclose the logicals in the which() function:\n\nwhich(fishdat$site == 'A')\n\nSo the first five rows are site A. There are other sorts of logical quesions for instance:\n\nwhich(fishdat$site !='A')\nwhich(fishdat$dN15_SG &gt; 11.99)\nwhich(fishdat$dN15_SG &gt;= 11.99)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Would you consider yourself to be a science communicator, that is not just writing papers but doing other activities like doing interviews on radio?\n\n\n\nPhoto: Tom Rayner\n\n\nThis story is about how I became a science communicator, without ever intending too.\nThis blog is based on a talk I gave for the launch of the Australian Rivers Institute’s new science magazine.\nI used to think scicomm was doing interviews for print, radio and TV to try and reach general public. I definitely didn’t want to do interviews growing up. I wanted to be a marine biologist and help ocean ecosystems. Looking back though, it turns out I was always a keen science communicator.\nIn high school I took a creative writing course, as a kind of break from all the science and maths I was doing. My peers in the course were writing beautiful poems about love, drinking and drugs (we were 16!). I was the nerdy kid imagining I was a journalist for Scientific American, writing non-fiction magazine articles about cool science.\nI never got very good marks in writing, but my creative writing teacher (Karen Clark) said something that has stuck in my head all these years. “keep practicising writing Chris, you will get good at it” (or something like that, it was a few years ago).\nWhen I went on to do my PhD at UQ, writing become about papers and very technical.\nDuring my PhD I was invited by Ben Halpern to attend training on science communications at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nIt was there I learned about Nancy Baron’s work “Escape from the Ivory Tower”. I became convinced that it was crucial for us to escape the ivory tower if science was to inform better policies and decisions about the environment. I thought I should try to do more scicomm.\nThe course was a lot about media interviews. I did a mock interview with an actual journalist from Scientific American, and failed badly. I felt that if this was what scicomm was about, it definitely wasn’t for me. At the course they also taught us about Twitter and I became interested in how we could connect with other people through social media.\nI started tweeting in my first postdoc. But more importantly, I started seeing a lot of blogs on twitter. Now as a young postdoc at UQ I felt my emerging identity as an independent thinker and scientist was lost in UQ’s academic machine.\nI realised that starting my own blog was a way I could present the identity I wanted to present to the world with full control. And share my own thoughts. So I started blogging.\nAt the same time I was still trying to escape from the ivory tower and the opportunity arose to do an interview for some North Queensland papers on my new study. When I arrived at the office next data the Uni’s media person had posted the article on the message board. Turns out the newspaper had also asked some local fisherman what they thought of my study. They had printed a quote in large font:\n\n“These guys have no brains”\n\nYep, interviews and scicomm weren’t for me.\nBut I kept blogging.\nAnd my blogs were being read. I would meet people overseas at workshops and they would say ‘hey I read your blog’. That was exciting. But I was really only reaching other scientists.\nBy the time I came to ARI I was becoming addicted to blogging. So much so that now I write about a PhD thesis worth of words in blogs every 18 months.\nI hope one day I bump into my creative writing teacher on the street so I can tell her “hey, I practiced and I became a Writer!”\nThings changed when I came to the Australian Rivers Institute and I started to identify as a science communicator. I think it is indicative of the wonderful supportive culture we have at ARI. The institute is great at supporting the career development of its ECRs.\nAt ARI I set up the institute’s blog and twitter feed (where I also do 10s of blogs per year and edit many more). I would help my colleagues write blogs about their science papers in a more accessible form. And I found I really enjoyed it.\nI also learned there never was an ivory tower at ARI. Everyone was doing such great applied work, such as that the work Stuart Bunn and Michele Burford do with the National Environmental Science Program. Under this funding they are working directly with stakeholders to set science priorities and do the research that was needed.\nThat really changed my perspective on scicomm, it wasn’t just about interviews with journalists, it could be more targeted, directly speaking to the people that needed the research the most.\nThen Liz O’Brien from Griffith’s Research Office encouraged me to apply for a Tall Young Poppy Award in science media and communication and I won one. The recognition really helped me to start to identify as a communicator.\nSo then we went further and set up the ARI Scicomm cadets program. So we are currently training four of our ECRs in science communications skills, everything from tweeting to engaging with stakeholders. And they are running some amazing activities like Man’s international Cyanobacteria Twitter conference that is coming up next month.\nThen Prof Rod Connolly invited me to join an application for funding that has become the Global Wetlands Project. We hired a full-time science communicator. He’s here today – Tom Rayner – and is doing some amazing things that more strategic than I ever dreamed scicomm could be. We have integrated scicomm into our research from day 1, and have a strategy for everything from training ECRs to how to facilitate a two-way dialogue between researchers and stakeholders.\nTom and I are currently working on how we will monitor the project’s impact with stakeholders, so we can map the project’s pathways to impact over its 4 year duration.\nWith all of this interest in scicomm, I am very pleased to be at ARI as a researcher and science communicator for the launch of ARI’s magazine.\nThe magazine for me represents much of what ARI is about. It is showing to the world that not all scientists are stuck in the ivory tower.\nIt gives our early career researchers a voice so they can start to create their own research identity.\nIt is about reaching out to stakeholders and starting a conversation that will hopefully lead to better more useful science and more effective decision about our environment. People are less likely to raise comments like ‘they have no brains’ if they’ve had the chance to contribute to the science from day one.\nSo now you’ve heard my story, I’ll ask you again, are you a science communicator?"

    "text": "Program overview\nCoastal wetlands – mangroves, seagrass, saltmarsh and estuaries – are valuable ecosystems with high biodiversity. Long favoured as sites for human settlements, they provide us with safe ports, fisheries resources, and access to fresh water. They are critically important in the production of seafood and they assist in protecting coastlines from extreme weather events, now and as sea levels rise.\n\nHowever as the world’s coastal cities continue to grow and industrialise, many coastal wetlands are facing major declines in ecosystem health. We therefore propose to shine a spotlight on where the problems are, what needs to be done to protect what we have, and where rehabilitation will be most effective.\n​To achieve this, we are assessing coastal wetland health around the world, to:\n-highlight the most urgent issues facing coastal wetlands -guide targeted investment and practical actions towards protection and rehabilitation\nWe will:\n-develop and apply globally applicable measures of coastal wetland ecosystem health, -identify locations most in need of protection and rehabilitation, as a guide to where investment in conservation actions can be most effective, -build web-based scenario models to help conservation-focussed projects identify cost effective options for protection and rehabilitation.\nWe are kicking off the project at six trial locations: Portugal, South Africa, India, China, Australia, Vanuatu. And then expanding to the rest of the world’s coastal wetlands. Positions available\nTo achieve the Program’s objectives, Griffith University is recruiting a science team capable of solving significant marine science challenges.\nThis is an opportunity to be part of a major initiative promoting the health of key ecosystems – mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass and estuaries – and to advance the science of urbanisation, multiple stressors, climate responses and automated monitoring. Researchers will work in a supportive team with complementary skills in ecology, statistical modelling, big data, automation and science communication.\nThis four-year, internationally funded program is based at Griffith University’s largest campus on the Gold Coast, southeast Queensland, Australia. This is a hub for marine science, in a city surrounded by surf beaches, estuarine wetlands and montane rainforest, and with easy access to two international airports. ​ ## Positions available:\nMarine Ecologist\nStatistical Ecologist\nScience Communicator\nSoftware Engineer\nUse individual links above for more information.

    "text": "2018 has been a big year for me, at work and home. I started several major grants, including starting new PhD students and hiring my first ever postdoc. Then very quickly I also hired my 2nd and 3rd ever postdocs. All this hiring meant I had to chair interview panels for the first time.\nI don’t think the first few candidates realised, but I was as nervous as they were.\nAt home my second son was born. Cradling his floppy little head in hospital I had that feeling again that there was something wrong that society would let such a naive Dad look after this child’s fragile life. I often feel like I’m learning to be a Dad by ‘trial and error’ and that someone will pull me up for poor parent skills, like not holding a baby properly.\nAll these feelings of not being capable may be imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is the feeling that you are a fraud, and that all you’ve achieved is false. You feel like you will eventually be caught out by someone and everything will come tumbling down. You have this feeling even though there is quantitative evidence that you are in fact the real deal (ok so I did win the grants, and yes I am a capable father who has raised another child).\nImposter syndrome is becoming increasingly well recognized in academic circles, because it often affects successful people. I think there is evidence that women are more prone to it than men, though we men can certainly be affected too.\nSo an important development goal for someone’s PhD is not just to grow their knowledge, but also their confidence in that knowledge. This might include the confidence to present seminars, conduct statistics, write papers, debate, do job interviews, or even just speak with colleagues.\nLearning to be humble about your knowledge can be important too, though I think this need is rarer in early career scientists.\nMany people with imposter syndrome may not even realise they can overcome it. If they are even aware of their own low confidence they may see it as an inherent trait, like it’s part of their DNA. In fact, you can write your own story about who you are.\nI want to share here how I grappled with imposter syndrome and how I’ve learned to be more confident and overcome low self-esteem.\nI’ll focus on the parts of the story I think are lessons that others can act on. I hope this helps you."

    "text": "My story about low self-esteem and cultivating confidence\nI did my PhD in a very successful lab group. I remember three months into my PhD feeling extremely stressed. Many of my peers who had started 6 months before me had submitted their first PhD papers to journals like Science. I was asking myself how I deserved to be there. I was months in and I hadn’t submitted a paper yet!\nA few years later I shared this experience with some of my peers. They laughed. Apparently just before I started the lab lead had printed my CV and left it on the tea-room table. The other students had been somewhat intimidated by some of my academic achievements in undergrad.\nThe lesson I learned was that we often compare ourselves against other people’s achievements and find ourselves to be lacking. We fail to remember that we too have been successful, but in different ways. It is like looking at someone’s Instagram feed: They select only the amazing things to post about their holiday, and you think they have a much more interesting life than you have. If you talk to them though, you find out that the holiday was mostly mundane, or downright dreadful.\nIt is important to learn that you can write your own story of what success is, and you can write this story around your own strengths.\nIf you are not sure what your strengths are, find a trusted friend or colleague and ask them. Another way to find your strengths is to write down your ‘weaknesses’. Your strengths will often be the flip side of your weaknesses. So if one of your weaknesses was taking on too much for other people, maybe your strength is teamwork.\nI don’t know why I thought I was failing so early on in my PhD. I think it goes back to low self-esteem from my teenage years. I was often bullied in high school. Rarely did I think I was ‘good’ at anything. When I did well in class, I usually put it down to luck or hard work."

As I progressed to the later years of high-school I escaped from some of the social circles that were putting me down. Those later years also saw a greater emphasis on learning and study and, for me, access to some great mentors who encouraged my interest in ecology and science.\nStudying at university meant I found peers who also shared my passion for ecology and science. I gained the respect of my peers for the knowledge I did have. For instance, I often helped my peers study for exams. This really helped me develop more confidence.\nFinding a positive group of peers and mentors is important for growing your confidence. In my PhD and onto my postdoc I had finally found a community that grew my confidence, rather than putting me down like in high-school. Many of them became close friends.\nAs my Phd went on I started to ask the other students or postdocs in the lab for help on everything from admin to statistics to finding a house. This helped me find a community among other PhD students and postdocs who become a crucial support network. I learned from them that others who seemed so successful had also faced the same fears of failure as me, but overcame them.\nSo a community of support can help you grow your confidence. Often all it takes is to ask someone for help."

I looked back at the acknowledgements from my PhD and a quote about my supervisors stands out:\n\n“I could not have emerged from this PhD confident about making a career in scientific research without their guidance, but also the freedom they gave me to make mistakes.”\n\nBecause we all make mistakes sometimes, I think it is important for supervisors to let you make them, or, if not, find your own mentors that help you reconcile and learn from them.\nIf your supervisor is putting you down, maybe you need to find another mentor. Or be brave and ask them to be more positive. Criticism is hardwired into academic culture (and so it should be), but sometimes supervisors can be more critical and negative than they realise.\nAlong the way in my PhD I got to present at conferences. I was well prepared and I did a good enough job to get positive feedback from other scientists. I also got some papers through peer-review. Some times the reviews (and even coauthors!) were hyper-negative. Sometimes they were positive. But the end result of the published paper was always a boost to my confidence. So putting the work in to making these achievements happen was crucial to building my confidence.\nThrough my PhD I started learning the R programming language, which has become instrumental to my career. As I got better I realised it was knowledge other people wanted to have too. So into my postdoc I started teaching R to others, something I continue to this day.\nI’ve found teaching something you know well, even to just one or two people, is a great way to build your confidence. It is like the Instagram situation in reverse, you see other people are hungry for what you have."

And I have learned to love running straight into it.\n\nI have been helped to overcome imposter syndrome by the realization that confronting fears in any form is a kind of sport\n\nThis might seem odd to you, but hey I’m a Dad, I don’t get as much time surfing and climbing as I used too, so writing is my way to get a rush now.\nPart of this realization is that the consequences of mistakes usually aren’t that high. I’m fortunate (or getting old!) to have the experience of making mistakes and surviving many times. Usually the outcome is just being slightly embarrassed, but then you correct them and nothing else happens. Unlike extreme sports athletes, we don’t get physical wounds from errors in equations, hidden flaws in experimental designs or missing references.\nThese blogs, especially the personal ones that make me feel vulnerable, are another way I practice ‘extreme’ writing."

    "text": "Experimenting with your career and learning from mistakes\nThe final tool that’s helped me with imposter syndrome is seeing everything as a series of experiments.\nSome people say we should embrace failure as a way of learning. I prefer to see failure as part of experimentation.\nI recognized that the change in my job from being an postdoc to a supervisor meant this year would be a big year of learning. I reconciled with myself that there would undoubtedly be mistakes, and while I would try to avoid them, I would learn from those that I did make.\nSo next time you hesitate because of the risk of failure, try looking at the challenge as an experiment. Ask yourself, how might I run this experiment to maximize the learning, but minimise the costs of failure?\nFor instance, I recently submitted a paper on some eco-stats that were pretty new to me (and ecologists). But I posted the manuscript on a pre-print server and sought pre-review feedback before submitting it. I made some helpful corrections that way.\nI’ll leave you with a story from a friend. My friend met someone who was selling a book series about how to raise your kids. The salesman made a convincing sales pitch to my friend about how the books would direct her to raise smart and well balanced children. But at the end my friend said she didn’t want the books. The salesman asked why and my friend said:\n\n“These books would take the trial and error out of parenting. My children are my experiments, I don’t want to lose that joy.”"

If you follow the link on the help page for the handy brewer.pal function, you can get to a web app that lets you choose the type of palette (linear, diverging, qualitative), the number of colours and other options, like palettes that will be visable to people who are red-green colour blind (about 4% of the population).This all extremely useful, but RColorBrewer palettes are generally limited to a maximum of 10 different colours. What if you want to have a continuous scale? Here I run through how to make a colour ramp from a Brewer palette.Note though, that the designers of RColorBrewer limited the number of colours as a deliberate choice. The colour palettes are mainly designed for maps, and in general, people can’t keep more than about 7 categories in their head at any one time. Hence, before you create your figure, think about how you want to represent on your figure. For instance, say you are plotting elevation. Choosing a few colours will emphasis zones in elevation, for instance, maybe you want to represent different vegetation zones that change with altitude. Whereas, a continuous palette will obviously represent the data as more of a gradient.\n\n\n\nColour Brewer categorical colours\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nbluecols &lt;- brewer.pal(9, 'Blues')\n\nWhich just makes a pie with nine different shades of blue. ### A colour ramp We can use the colorRampPalette() function to create a new function, here newcol(). newcol() takes a single integer as an argument, which outputs the colour ramp using our blue palette.\n\nnewcol &lt;- colorRampPalette(bluecols)\nncols &lt;- 100\nbluecols2 &lt;- newcol(ncols)#apply the function to get 100 colours\n\nAnd that is it.

    "text": "An important goal for me as supervisor of PhD students is to build their confidence. Building confidence in a scientific topic comes through growing a student’s knowledge in a discipline and its methods. Growth in confidence can also come through how a supervisor mentors their student. Compliments can be part of that growth.\nI only recently realised there is an important difference between praise and encouragement, particularly when it comes to building confidence.\nA fundamental difference is that the praise you give reflects your own values, whereas encouragement asks someone to identify what they value. In this sense praise could be seen as coming from a selfish point of view (I value that, therefore you should to), whereas encouragement shows interest in what someone else values, without passing your own judgement on those values.\nLet me give some examples.\nSay a senior professor approaches a student and she says “Those analyses you are doing are groundbreaking. You are so clever with statistics. I am so proud of how much you have learned here.”\nThis is praise. In fact, what I wrote is so corny you might start to wonder if they are trying to flatter you to get something out of you.\nThe praise can be more subtle than my example. One tell-tale sign is labels. The prof is labelling your work (and by implication you) as groundrbreaking, they are labelling as someone who is clever at statistics. They are saying what you are doing is making them proud. This is praise and it all comes from a place of the values they hold for you and your work."

    "text": "Praise, confidence and manipulation\nPraise can be well-intentioned and I don’t mean to knock people who praise (I compliment my students often!). Praise can also build confidence and many good people who mean the best for you will praise you.\nThe problem with praise is that it can also build dependency of the student on the supervisor. The supervisor is setting up a situation where the student needs to come to the supervisor to build their self-worth. The student’s self-worth is portrayed through the supervisors eyes, and so is external to the student themselves.\nPraise isn’t effective at building intrinsic self-worth.\nYou could say the entirety of academic culture is built on praise. You wouldn’t be far wrong. Academic culture places immense value on status symbols like fancy journals, titles, commendations from peers and awards. These things are all labels for the value we’re told we should place in a scientist’s career.\nPraise is frequently employed by academics to ensure other people say ‘yes’ to an ask. These are traps academics set for each other (I’ve been known to set them on occasion too!). A colleague once wanted my help for their conference so they wrote to me saying: “I’m looking for thought leaders to help organize this conference…”\nThis use of praise not necessarily a bad thing, organizing conferences is an important part of a career. But as it happens I didn’t have the time or inclination to help with that particular conference. So I laughed to myself and turned the opportunity down. (If you are are sucker for saying ‘yes’, try ithinkwell’s advice about “not saying yes”).\nBut praise is also occurs in more extreme and harmful cases of manipulation. In fact, in recent news about bullying in academia, ‘praise’ has been frequently mentioned by the victims. In these extreme cases praise becomes one of the tools a bully uses to break down a student’s confidence. The bullying will follow a cycle of praising to create dependence, but then put-downs to further suppress any hope the student had of developing their own self-worth and thus gaining independence from the bully.\nSo notice the things people say to you and think critically. Is it praise? Are they labelling you? If they are praising you, what is the context? It may be because they truly want you to feel good about what you’ve accomplished, like your parents telling you they are proud of the award of your PhD. It may be because they need your help with something, which could be good for your career, or a time-consuming distraction. Or it may be they are trying to manipulate you in more serious way."

    "text": "Encouragement and self-worth\nSo what’s the alternative to praise for supervisors who want to build a student’s intrinsic self-worth?\nEncouragement is about helping someone find their own intrinsic values for what they are doing. To give some examples, lets revisit our Prof from before, but re-write what she said as encouragement:\n“What do you think are the most important next steps for solving the statistical issues our field faces? Do you enjoy the work on analysis you are doing? What are you most proud of in the paper you just published?”\nNow these questions are asking the student what their intrinsic values are. The student isn’t being labelled. The prof isn’t making any value judgements on the work. They are helping the student identify their own values.\nIt could also be encouragement for the Prof to say “Thank you for presenting your work, it has been really helpful for my own research to learn about these new techniques.” Here the Prof is sharing how she was encouraged by the presentation, without offering any labels for the student’s work.\nUltimately encouragement helps someone to become more independent of what others think of them. If you deeply understand what you like doing and what you value most, then you can pursue career satisfaction without the need for external validation.\nEndnote I learned these ideas about praise vs encouragement in an odd way. I was listening to a parenting podcast about raising confident children and it was talking about praise vs encouragement. I wouldn’t normally draw parallels between students and children! But ‘praise’ has also come up in several recent bullying cases and at the same time I’ve been ‘encouraged’ to use encouragement in leadership courses I’ve taken. In fact, many global leaders say having children was a turning point that enabled them to be better leaders. Just goes to show we should be supporting parents of all genders to stay in academia."

    "text": "Smoothing non-linear trends with Bayesian models\nWe chose to use a Bayesian time-series modelling technique. This isn’t as complex as it sounds. It is really just a Bayesian extension of GLMs.\nThe clever extension (not our invention!) is to use a random walk to model non-linear trends in population size. In effect, the random walk is just saying each year’s population has some dependency on the previous year.\nYou can think of the random walk as telling us about how strongly the value of next year is constrained by the value this year.\nThe neat thing about Bayesian methods (as opposed to frequentist methods) is we get to use prior information for the variance of the random walk. This means we can control the strength of the random walk. More variance = potentially bigger steps in the random walk. Less variance = smaller steps.\nEventually if we tell the prior that there is effectively no variance in the random walk, the model will always estimate a flat line. If you let the prior have very large variance, then the random walk will follow the data very closely.\nWe usually want to be somewhere in the middle of the two extremes of a flat trend versus a trend that tracks every slight wiggle. We want a trend line that ‘smooths’ the data. See the picture.\n\nThe idea for this paper started with a blog a couple years ago, where I explained the idea of smoothing a random walk with prior information.\nWe used the R-INLA framework for our model. This is a handy tool, because we could model other, non-temporal, source of variation too. Like differences in trends by sites."

    "text": "Priors informed by life-history traits\nSo why use Bayesian methods for tiger shark time-series? Well the Bayesian priors mean we can inform the time-series models with other information. Like life-history traits.\nTiger sharks are in decline on the East Coast of Australia, we want to know by how much, because that information is important for informing conservation decisions. This means we need to smooth out all the noise in the data to estimate a long-term trend.\nHolly Kindsvater and co explain the idea of priors very elegantly. But basically conservation biology has a data crisis. We need to make the most of the information we have.\nIf we used the more traditional techniques, like GAMs, we only get to use the time-series data to estimate the level of smoothing. But why ignore other sources of data when we could use them?\n\n\n\nThe method for informing priors\n\n\nWe show that the random walk variance can be informed by life-history information (see picture). These are measurements scientists have made of tiger sharks, which do not depend on time-series. For instance, information like, at what age do tiger sharks breed and how many babies do they have?\nThis life-history information tells us how rapidly the tiger shark population is likely to change under natural conditions. So we use it to constrain the random walk.\nWe then used a special type of prior, a penalized complexity prior to ensure that we could capture less common, but rapid changes in abundance, which may be caused by humans killing things."

    "text": "Does data quantity matter?\nOf course! But we wanted to know how much data you need. We had a lot of data in this instance, almost 10,000 shark captures over 33 years at 11 regions.\nSo we ran simulations where we used only some of the data (The INLA technique came in handy here, because it runs so FAST).\nIt turns out the informed priors did pretty well at getting a good estimate of the trend when there was less data.\nThe ‘default’ priors also did very well (ie what you get if you don’t tell INLA what prior to use). I hope the developers of the INLA penalized complexity prior are pleased to hear this.\nHowever, we think it is still good to make use of life-history information. Informed priors help to justify modelling decisions, which can be important when trends are used to inform policy debates."

Not least because of a court battle between environmental lawyers and the Queensland government, over government policy to shoot sharks they catch in beach protection programs.\nWe’ve also found declines in other large sharks, including threatened species.\nEveryone keeps asking us what is causing these shark declines. So we’d like to do some modelling of different causes of mortality (commercial fishing, recreational fishing, shark control programs etc…) to see what matters most."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Netflix film ‘Seaspiracy’ has stirred up controversy for among scientists for good reason. BUT the film is creating lots of opportunities to talk about ocean conservation with general public, like family, uber drivers and hairdressers.\nIn our lab meeting today we discussed the film (I refuse to call it a ‘documentary’).\nThe film mixes up true facts with misrepresentation in a narrative that one supposes is designed to confuse people and turn them off eating seafood altogether. This message does damage to efforts that are trying to make fisheries more sustainable by having people make sustainable choices in their purchases.\nIf you find yourself in a discussion about the film, here are some talking points (with an Australian spin):\n\nTalking points for scientists\nOverfishing is a global issue and arguably the most significant issue marine life and ocean food production face. It is not just Japanese and Chinese to blame, and its not just industrial fisheries. Australia still has in some fisheries an overfishing problem. Many small scale fisheries, including some of Australia’s recreational fisheries, have overfishing issues. But many nations, including Australia, have worked hard to manage their fisheries better (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was designed alongside fisheries regulations very effectively) and many fisheries are doing better thanks to those efforts.\nThe film misrepresents the facts and tells mistruths in a way that one can only suppose was deliberately designed to turn people off seafood. It is not true what they say that you can’t tell where your seafood comes from. There are many resources to help you make sustainable choices. Making sustainable choices is a positive way to make change, it encourages the industry to do better. There are many examples of where this has worked, but the film neglected to show them. Things you can do include: Refer to your local sustainable seafood guide. In Australia that would be the very reputable one published by the Australian Marine Conservation Society (https://www.marineconservation.org.au/sustainable-seafood-choices/ also comes as a handy app!).\nAsk your fish salesperson questions about where the fish come from and how it was caught. This let’s them know their customers care about sustainability.\nAustralia, and many other places, are laggards in labelling seafood. So get involved with research trying to make it better. For instance, if you live in South East Queensland you can do help researchers by doing this simple survey when you buy fish.\nFinally, tell them that while overfishing is important, its not the only issue oceans face. Cue discussion of what you do in your research!\n\n\nDebating tips\nIf you get drawn into a debate on the film, focus on the bigger picture. Be careful about debating facts if you are not up to date with them. I’ve met many a ‘climate’ expert who has ‘facts’ to dispute climate change. Its true I don’t know much about the entire science of climate change, its huge, so I can never know enough to refute every myth. For Seaspiracy this page is a good start for a fact check on some common ones: https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/science-of-seaspiracy/\nThe facts are important, but remember the bigger picture. Its the overall message and way they are stitched together (some facts do check out as true) that misrepresents what we need to do about overfishing.\nSome important questions are why don’t they talk to any actual fishers (they talk to a whaler in the Faroes and a slave, too very extreme cases that I’m not sure you’d classify as typical fishers)? Why do all the interviews with the ‘bad guys’ come off badly, whereas the ‘good guys’ (conservationists and vegan food companies) seem so perfectly polished? Why do they go to all those lengths to investigate conflicts of interests in Dolphin Safe tuna, but not report CoI for their experts (like the book author who owns a vegan food company)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Costing the impact of cyclone Winston on Fiji’s ecosystem services\nTropical cyclone Winston hit Fiji in February 2016 leaving 43 people dead, 120,000 without shelter and devastating infrastructure . As Fiji recovers, Fiji’s government is working to document the cost of this event to their economy.\n\n\n\nTropical cyclone Winston damages schools. Image:  ABC news.\n\n\nOur Science for Nature and People Partnership group on ‘Ridge to reef fisheries’ is supporting Fiji’s government to help document the cost of the cyclone to the services that Fiji’s ecosystems provide to people.\nAssessments of economic damage from natural disaster’s typically only include direct economic costs, like the cost of repairing damaged schools. Such costings underestimate the true cost of natural disaster’s to society, because they do not account for damage to ecosystems. Ecosystems provide many goods and services that are important for people’s jobs and economic security.\nFor instance, coral reef ecosystems support the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people globally. In Fiji they support people through drawing tourists and providing for fisheries.\n\n\n\nCoral reef fisheries support the livelihoods of many people in tropical nations.\n\n\nReef ecosystems can be impacted by cyclones. The impacts can be direct, for instance the cyclone can tear up the reef. Impacts of cyclones can also be indirect. Heavy rainfall on land carries sediment and pollutants into rivers which then flow out to sea. The turbid waters can smother corals, killing them. Fish in turn depend on the coral habitat, so the whole ecosystem may be affected.\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society is working in Fiji and has a strong partnership with government. They have been working closely with the Fiji Government to provide inputs into the Post Disaster Needs Assessment to ensure that the assessment of the cyclones’s damage includes lost ecosystem services.\nIt can be challenging to mobilise a science team to document costs after a natural disaster like a cyclone. Fortunately, our SNaPP group has already been working on documenting Fiji’s ecosystem services on land and in the sea. The objective of our work is to help plan land-use change to minimise the run-off of pollutants into the ocean, where they may impact on fisheries.\nRun-off of turbid water can be worsened by land-clearing. Loss of forest destablises the soil, so more soil runs into rivers with rain. Trees also break the energy of the rainfall and absorb some of the rain, so more trees mean less of the rainfall runs into rivers.\nOur team has provided the Fiji government with some basic information about catchments and forest cover on the island of Vanua Levu, one of the most affected regions (see image).\n\n\n\nForest cover in Vanua Levu’s major catchments, estimated as part of our SNaP working group.\n\n\nThe information about catchments and landcover will be used by government to help them document the cost of the cyclone to ecosystem services, and help formulate actions that can be taken as Fiji begins the earlier recovery phase, which includes better land-sea management.\nThe cyclone has also seen a shift in the science priorities for our working group. The Wildlife Conservation Society had been working towards an integrated coastal management planning meeting with government and Fijian communities in May. The meeting was to discuss the future of land-use change in parts of Fiji.\nThe SNaPP team had been working towards supporting the planning meeting, by providing estimates for how much pollution may cost fisheries and associated livelihoods. However, this natural disaster has seen a shift in local priorities, as people have suddenly become much more aware of the impact of extreme run-off events.\nOur SNaPP team is now working to incorporate extreme events into the scientific advice we provide. We hope that information about extreme events will resonate with local stakeholders and help to highlight the importance of protecting local ecosystem services."

Humanities footprint on the Earth’s ecosystem has never been greater. The oceans are increasingly being industrialized, and climate change means the footprint of human economic activity now touches even the most remote ecosystems.\nCoastal ecosystems exemplify the challenges we face in managing our growing impacts. Coasts are the thin line on which much of the human population and industrial activity rests. This human activity places great pressures on coastal ecosystems, and in many places we are losing species and the ecological functions that support human livelihoods, like fisheries.\nPredicting the future for coastal ecosystems is critical for creating a sustainable relationship between humanity and nature.

    "title": "Seagrass habitats lack protection at a global scale",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This blog was written by PhD student Laura Griffiths.\nSeagrass ecosystems face multiple threats, from pollution to sea level rise. However, management is failing to adequately protect these ecosystems and prevent their decline. We reviewed global policy relevant to seagrass protection and identified some critical gaps. We need to rethink how we protect coastal ecosystems in general, and seagrasses in particular, from multiple cumulative threats.\n\nSeagrass ecosystems are one of the most widespread coastal ecosystems on the planet. They are crucial to the world’s carbons stores, are an essential habitat for biodiversity conservation and provide income and food security for thousands of local communities world-wide.\nHowever, overburdened by human activities at the land sea interface, these ecosystems have undergone significant decline in the last few decades. Losses of up to 7% per year have been shown globally. Identifying the root cause of this continued loss by looking at management under the microscope reveals the missing pieces necessary to protect these essential ecosystems.\nWe took a look at twenty sites around the world. These included sites with high cumulative impacts and covered all levels of governance structure to see how seagrass ecosystems were being managed. The aim was to underpin the root causes leading to their mismanagement and associated decline. We looked at all relevant management related documents such as legislation, policies, plans, etc.. to understand how, and if, threats to seagrass were being targeted with a management action.\nWhat we found was that seagrass ecosystems were poorly protected across the globe. Failure was apparent in that they were not recognised or valued legally (through legislation) in many cases. The worst managed habitats were in countries with a low human development index. In cases where they were valued, management was generally insufficient to protect seagrass ecosystems from the suite of anthropogenic threats. A sector-led management approach incapable of crossing physical (i.e. land and sea) and jurisdictional boundaries were the main reasons preventing adequate protection.\nHaving said that there were three case studies that stood out against this backdrop of under protection. These were the shining lights that the world can look to for guidance moving forward. They were the Trilateral Wadden Sea Plan, Reef 2050 Long Term Sustainability Plan, and the Pilot Draft Plan for the Western Part of the Gulf of Gdansk.\nSuccessful protection of seagrass requires holistic management of threats from land and the sea. Holistic management can be achieved through integrated management plans. This means that urban planning departments need to speak their marine and freshwater counterparts and consider how human activities impact on coastal ecosystems.\nSome aspects to be considered include:\n\nthe location of stormwater drainage, sewage outfalls and dredge spoil\ncontrol over recreational activities that scour the seafloor like motorised watercraft, fishing for worms and trampling\nmodification of coastal structures like pontoons and jetties to allow sufficient light penetration\nreview of water quality guidelines to minimize the effect of turbidity, particularly in semi enclosed embayments\nrestore seagrass habitat at alternative sites when smothered by land reclamation projects\ngreater support for monitoring of seagrass habitat to ascertain historical loss and determine current spatial extent\nevaluate how ecosystem services like productive fisheries can be supported in the future once losses are realised\nthe inclusion of cumulative impact policies into the planning and decision-making process\n\nMore importantly the study identified that recognition of value through legislation and policies is the first step to better protect seagrass ecosystems. Without this fundamental initiative it is likely that the status of seagrass ecosystems will continue to degrade."

    "title": "How much has the data informed your isotope mixing model",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The contributions of different food sources to animal diets is often a mystery. Isotopes provide a means to estimate those contributions, because different food sources often have different isotopic signatures. We would typically use a Bayesian mixing model to estimate the proportional contributions of different food sources to samples taken from the animal.\nIsotope mixing models are fitted within a Bayesian framework. This means that the end results (AKA ‘posterior distributions’) are influenced by the data, the model and the prior distributions. Priors are specified for each parameter in the model, including the source contributions.\nIn the article “Quantifying learning in biotracer studies” (Brown,et al. Oecologia 2018) we describe how comparing priors and posteriors with information criteria is important to determine the influence of the data on the model.\nThis blog describes how to use my BayeSens R package to calculate information criteria for mixing models.\n\n\nThe default prior for most mixing model has a mean of 1/n, where n is the number of sources. So if we had five potential food sources this means our starting assumption is that on average the consumer eats and assimilates 20% of each prey item.\nUncareful use of mixing models has resulted in findings from some peer-reviewed being contested. For instance, if the user just puts sources in the model ‘just to see’ if they matter, the starting assumption is that, on average, each contributes an equal fraction to the diet. This starting assumption is in many cases ridicilous.\nWhen the data are not particularly informative, the model will return the result that every item contributed an equal fraction to the animals diet. The authors may then write this up as a new ‘result’ when in fact it was just the default assumption of the software package being reflected in their outputs.\nIn general I am quite suspicious of all the isotope studies reporting generalist consumers that eat equal fractions of prey. These patterns may well just reflect the default priors.\nAdding to the confusion is that some call the default priors ‘uninformative’.\nPriors for mixing models are all informative, eventhe so called ‘uninformative’ priors. The prior for source contributions bounded between 0-1, and source contributions must sum to 1, so it can never be truly flat in that range.\n\n\n\nYou should always plot your priors and posteriors to check what is going on. You can very quickly identify this issue of uninformative data. Then in your write up, you could put less emphasis on results that look like the priors.\nYou can also calculate statistics that measure how different prior and posterior are. In our paper, we described several statistics taken from information theory. You can then easily report these statistics to summarize where prior and posterior are different (or not).\nFor instance, in a recent study of coastal fish specices we fitted many models across many species and regions, so we reported the differences as a table in the supplemental material.\n\n\n\nThis blog demonstrates how information criteria can be calculated for mixing models fit with MixSIAR.\nWe will apply the simple marginal information criteria from that paper to the Killer Whale example, see vignette(\"killerwhale_ex\") in MixSIAR.\nThe killer whale example is a nice simple one with no covariates or random effects. If you have covariates or random effects, you’ll need to be careful to compare priors to posteriors at the same locations on the fixed/random effects.\nIt will be helpful to have some understanding of MixSIAR’s data structures, because we need to find the posterior samples in the model output.\n\n\n\nFirst load the packages we need:\nlibrary(BayeSens)\nlibrary(MixSIAR)\nNow load the data (this is verbatim from the Killer whale example).\nmix.filename &lt;- system.file(\"extdata\", \"killerwhale_consumer.csv\", package = \"MixSIAR\")\n\nmix &lt;- load_mix_data(filename=mix.filename,\n                     iso_names=c(\"d13C\",\"d15N\"),\n                     factors=NULL,\n                     fac_random=NULL,\n                     fac_nested=NULL,\n                     cont_effects=NULL)\n\n\nsource.filename &lt;- system.file(\"extdata\", \"killerwhale_sources.csv\", package = \"MixSIAR\")\n\nsource &lt;- load_source_data(filename=source.filename,\n                           source_factors=NULL,\n                           conc_dep=FALSE,\n                           data_type=\"means\",\n                           mix)\n\ndiscr.filename &lt;- system.file(\"extdata\", \"killerwhale_discrimination.csv\", package = \"MixSIAR\")\n\ndiscr &lt;- load_discr_data(filename=discr.filename, mix)\n\n\n\nLet’s draw samples from the prior. You can also plot this with MixSIAR’s plot_prior function, but we need a matrix of the samples for calculating info criteria later.\nalpha &lt;- rep(1, source$n.sources) #default prior values\np_prior &lt;- MCMCpack::rdirichlet(10000, alpha) #draw prior samples\nLet’s plot just the prior for the first source (since they are all the same in this case)\n#Plot histogram and density (same data, different ways to view it )\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nhist(p_prior[,1], 20, main = source$source_names[1])\nplot(density(p_prior[,1]), main = source$source_names[1])\nabline(v = 1/source$n.sources)\n\nAs you can see the default prior clearly isn’t ‘uninformative’ because it is centred around 1/number of sources (in fact it has mean 1 over the number of sources). It might be better called the ‘uninformed’ (by the user) prior. This means the prior will have a lower mean the more sources you include in the model.\n\n\n\nThis is verbatim from the Killer Whales example.\nmodel_filename &lt;- \"MixSIAR_model_kw_uninf.txt\"   # Name of the JAGS model file\nresid_err &lt;- TRUE\nprocess_err &lt;- TRUE\nwrite_JAGS_model(model_filename, resid_err, process_err, mix, source)\njags.uninf &lt;- run_model(run=\"test\",mix,source,discr,model_filename,alpha.prior = alpha, resid_err, process_err)\n\n## module glm loaded\n\n## Compiling model graph\n##    Resolving undeclared variables\n##    Allocating nodes\n## Graph information:\n##    Observed stochastic nodes: 12\n##    Unobserved stochastic nodes: 23\n##    Total graph size: 766\n##\n## Initializing model\nI’ve used the test run mode here just to speed things up for the example.\nYou should absolutely use long chains (e.g. run = \"long\") when calculating info criteria. They are quite sensitive to the number of MCMC samples if there are few samples. We need enough samples to get a good idea of the posteriors full shape.\n\n\n\nHere’s where it helps to have some idea of how MixSIAR structures outputs. We need to find the posterior samples. You can dig around using str(jags.uninf). I did that and found the samples under jags.uninf$BUGSoutput as below:\np_post &lt;- jags.uninf$BUGSoutput$sims.list$p.global\nNow we have a matrix of prior samples and a matrix of posterior samples we can just compare them with the hellinger or kldiv (Kullback-Leibler divergence) functions from BayeSens. I’ll compare just the first source (Chinook salmon).\nhellinger(p_prior[,1], p_post[,1])\n\n## Hellinger distance - continuous\n## [1] 0.61\n##\n##  Hellinger distance - discrete\n## [1] 0.65\n\nkldiv(p_prior[,1], p_post[,1])\n\n## Kullback-Leibler divergence\n## [1] 5.7\nWe’d like to know what the info criteria are for all sources, so we could manually select columns to compare, or just use some sort of iterating function to do them all at once. Here I use lapply and put them into a dataframe:\nhell_out &lt;- lapply(1:source$n.sources, function(i) hellinger(p_prior[,i], p_post[,i])$hdist_disc)\nkl_out &lt;- lapply(1:source$n.sources, function(i) kldiv(p_prior[,i], p_post[,i])$kd)\ninfo_df &lt;- data.frame(source_names = source$source_names,\n                      hellinger = unlist(hell_out),\n                      KLD = unlist(kl_out))\ninfo_df\n\n##   source_names hellinger       KLD\n## 1      Chinook 0.6536184 5.6601980\n## 2         Chum 0.3659136 1.6746118\n## 3         Coho 0.3053054 0.9676074\n## 4      Sockeye 0.5260229 3.6985169\n## 5    Steelhead 0.5430961 4.2273867\nHellinger values near 0 are very similar to the priors, Hellinger values near 1 are very different to the priors. The KLD ranges from &gt;0 to infinity, so greater values indicate greater differences from the prior. So these results indicate to us that the model and data are not very informative about Coho, but much more informative about Chinook. To interpret why this is you should plot the priors and posteriors.\nYou can use output_JAGS to do this. We will do it ourselves, just to practice data wrangling. For Chinook and Coho:\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(density(p_post[,1]), main = source$source_names[1])\nlines(density(p_prior[,1]), col = \"red\")\nabline(v = 1/source$n.sources, lty = 2)\n\nplot(density(p_post[,3]), main = source$source_names[3])\nlines(density(p_prior[,3]), col = \"red\")\nabline(v = 1/source$n.sources, lty = 2)\n\nIt is pretty clear that contributions for Chinook have shifted higher, whereas the data doesn’t give us much reason to believe Coho are any more important than the prior suggested.\nNote that you can also get high information criteria stats if the posterior mean stays the same as the prior’s mean, but the distribution changes shape (e.g. gets thinner). For instance, if the data were strongly informative that Coho were not an important food source, then we could have the same posterior mean of 0.2, but the uncertainty intervals would be much narrower around 0.2 than in the prior.\n\n\n\nThe killer whale example also gives a model fit with informed priors. Here’s the code verbatim from MixSIAR:\nkw.alpha &lt;- c(10,1,0,0,3)\nkw.alpha &lt;- kw.alpha*length(kw.alpha)/sum(kw.alpha)\nkw.alpha[which(kw.alpha==0)] &lt;- 0.01\nmodel_filename &lt;- \"MixSIAR_model_kw_inf.txt\"  \nresid_err &lt;- TRUE\nprocess_err &lt;- TRUE\nwrite_JAGS_model(model_filename, resid_err, process_err, mix, source)\njags.inf &lt;- run_model(run=\"test\",mix,source,discr,model_filename,alpha.prior=kw.alpha, resid_err, process_err)\n\n## Compiling model graph\n##    Resolving undeclared variables\n##    Allocating nodes\n## Graph information:\n##    Observed stochastic nodes: 12\n##    Unobserved stochastic nodes: 23\n##    Total graph size: 766\n##\n## Initializing model\nThe only extra step we need to do now is draw samples from the prior and posteriors:\np_prior_inf &lt;- MCMCpack::rdirichlet(10000, kw.alpha) #draw prior samples\np_post_inf &lt;- jags.inf$BUGSoutput$sims.list$p.global\n\nhell_out_inf &lt;- lapply(1:source$n.sources, function(i) hellinger(p_prior_inf[,i], p_post_inf[,i])$hdist_disc)\n\n## Warning in sqrt(1 - integrate(fx1, minx, maxx)$value): NaNs produced\n\n## Warning in sqrt(1 - integrate(fx1, minx, maxx)$value): NaNs produced\n\nkl_out_inf &lt;- lapply(1:source$n.sources, function(i) kldiv(p_prior_inf[,i], p_post_inf[,i])$kd)\ninfo_df &lt;- cbind(info_df,\n                 data.frame(\n                      hellinger_inf = unlist(hell_out_inf),\n                      KLD_inf = unlist(kl_out_inf)))\ninfo_df\n\n##   source_names hellinger       KLD hellinger_inf   KLD_inf\n## 1      Chinook 0.6536184 5.6601980     0.7829688 8.7014174\n## 2         Chum 0.3659136 1.6746118     0.3353133 1.0081589\n## 3         Coho 0.3053054 0.9676074     0.1208581 0.1794651\n## 4      Sockeye 0.5260229 3.6985169     0.1262016 0.1923406\n## 5    Steelhead 0.5430961 4.2273867     0.6469540 5.7095752\nThe warning about NA’s comes from the prior for some groups being near zero, so the continuous version of the Hellinger stat isn’t able to be calculated. We are using the discrete version though, so its no problem to us.\nSo with the informed priors the Hellinger has increased for Chinook and Steelhead and decreased for the others.\nRemember that the information criteria just measure the distance from the prior. So if our data just confirm the informed priors, or there isn’t enough data to overcome the informed priors, then the information criteria will be near zero. In this case we have only two tracers and samples from 12 killer whales. The prior we used on Sockeye was very strong to zero consumption, so our result stays the same.\nThe below plot shows the priors in red and posteriors in black for the model with informed priors.\nplot(density(p_post_inf[,1]), lty = 2, main = \"informed prior\", xlim = c(0,1))\nlines(density(p_prior_inf[,1]), lty = 2, col = \"red\")\n\nI haven’t plotted the informed Coho model because both the prior and posterior are a spikes near zero.\nYou can clearly see the model has shifted the consumption of Coho downwards relative to the informed prior."

The authors may then write this up as a new ‘result’ when in fact it was just the default assumption of the software package being reflected in their outputs.\nIn general I am quite suspicious of all the isotope studies reporting generalist consumers that eat equal fractions of prey. These patterns may well just reflect the default priors.\nAdding to the confusion is that some call the default priors ‘uninformative’.\nPriors for mixing models are all informative, eventhe so called ‘uninformative’ priors. The prior for source contributions bounded between 0-1, and source contributions must sum to 1, so it can never be truly flat in that range."

Then in your write up, you could put less emphasis on results that look like the priors.\nYou can also calculate statistics that measure how different prior and posterior are. In our paper, we described several statistics taken from information theory. You can then easily report these statistics to summarize where prior and posterior are different (or not).\nFor instance, in a recent study of coastal fish specices we fitted many models across many species and regions, so we reported the differences as a table in the supplemental material."

If you have covariates or random effects, you’ll need to be careful to compare priors to posteriors at the same locations on the fixed/random effects.\nIt will be helpful to have some understanding of MixSIAR’s data structures, because we need to find the posterior samples in the model output."

    "text": "Here’s where it helps to have some idea of how MixSIAR structures outputs. We need to find the posterior samples. You can dig around using str(jags.uninf). I did that and found the samples under jags.uninf$BUGSoutput as below:\np_post &lt;- jags.uninf$BUGSoutput$sims.list$p.global\nNow we have a matrix of prior samples and a matrix of posterior samples we can just compare them with the hellinger or kldiv (Kullback-Leibler divergence) functions from BayeSens. I’ll compare just the first source (Chinook salmon).\nhellinger(p_prior[,1], p_post[,1])\n\n## Hellinger distance - continuous\n## [1] 0.61\n##\n##  Hellinger distance - discrete\n## [1] 0.65\n\nkldiv(p_prior[,1], p_post[,1])\n\n## Kullback-Leibler divergence\n## [1] 5.7\nWe’d like to know what the info criteria are for all sources, so we could manually select columns to compare, or just use some sort of iterating function to do them all at once. Here I use lapply and put them into a dataframe:\nhell_out &lt;- lapply(1:source$n.sources, function(i) hellinger(p_prior[,i], p_post[,i])$hdist_disc)\nkl_out &lt;- lapply(1:source$n.sources, function(i) kldiv(p_prior[,i], p_post[,i])$kd)\ninfo_df &lt;- data.frame(source_names = source$source_names,\n                      hellinger = unlist(hell_out),\n                      KLD = unlist(kl_out))\ninfo_df\n\n##   source_names hellinger       KLD\n## 1      Chinook 0.6536184 5.6601980\n## 2         Chum 0.3659136 1.6746118\n## 3         Coho 0.3053054 0.9676074\n## 4      Sockeye 0.5260229 3.6985169\n## 5    Steelhead 0.5430961 4.2273867\nHellinger values near 0 are very similar to the priors, Hellinger values near 1 are very different to the priors. The KLD ranges from &gt;0 to infinity, so greater values indicate greater differences from the prior. So these results indicate to us that the model and data are not very informative about Coho, but much more informative about Chinook. To interpret why this is you should plot the priors and posteriors.\nYou can use output_JAGS to do this. We will do it ourselves, just to practice data wrangling. For Chinook and Coho:\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(density(p_post[,1]), main = source$source_names[1])\nlines(density(p_prior[,1]), col = \"red\")\nabline(v = 1/source$n.sources, lty = 2)\n\nplot(density(p_post[,3]), main = source$source_names[3])\nlines(density(p_prior[,3]), col = \"red\")\nabline(v = 1/source$n.sources, lty = 2)\n\nIt is pretty clear that contributions for Chinook have shifted higher, whereas the data doesn’t give us much reason to believe Coho are any more important than the prior suggested.\nNote that you can also get high information criteria stats if the posterior mean stays the same as the prior’s mean, but the distribution changes shape (e.g. gets thinner). For instance, if the data were strongly informative that Coho were not an important food source, then we could have the same posterior mean of 0.2, but the uncertainty intervals would be much narrower around 0.2 than in the prior."

However, forecasts for fisheries species are often constrained by limited data from unfished reference conditions. No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) can provide insight into unfished population dynamics, potentially improving models’ predictive performance. This study asked whether incorporating NTMR data improves the accuracy of annual abundance forecasts over eight years. We compared the predictive performance of first-order autoregressive models that were trained on abundance data from either NTMR sites, fished sites, or a mix of both site types. Each model was then tested by predicting to sites it was not trained on (‘transferred’). We tested the forecasts for both fished and unfished species with 23 years of time-series abundance data from the Maria Island (Tasmania) NTMR and nearby control sites. We found a general decrease in the performance of fished and NTMR models when forecasts were transferred to the opposite site type. Model transferability was species-specific, with the NTMR model reducing forecasting errors by approximately 10% at fished sites for one sustainably fished species. In contrast, for other species, the fished model reduced forecast errors by approximately 4% and 56% at NTMR sites. Additionally, we found that models trained on a mix of site types consistently underperformed. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for site- and species-specific dynamics. While NTMR data offers valuable insights into unfished conditions, further work is required to create models that transfer well to any exploitation regime."

    "title": "Estimating harvest levels to reduce feral deer populations in Tasmania",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Feral deer were introduced to Tasmania for hunting, but are becoming an increasing environmental, agricultural and road safety issue. They damage sensitive vegetation and even disrupt attempts to restore coastal wetlands. A recent report shows results from a new survey indicating that the deer population is booming.\n(Here’s a news article summarizing the report).\nI’m interested in the question how much harvesting is required to reduce deer populations. As a fisheries scientists, I’m usually asking the reverse question, of how much harvesting is too much. In this case, we want to overharest to reduce populations.\nOne suggestion from recreational hunting groups is to allow more hunting to control deer populations. But how much hunting would have to happen and is it feasible for recreational hunters to take that much?\nThe management problem is that deer in Tasmania are managed in zones, including sustainable hunting zones and no-go zones. The no-go zones are there to protect sennsitive enviroments, whereas the hunting zones are there to manage deer populations to allow ongoing recreational hunting.\nBut deer don’t obey jurisdictional boundaries and the new survey clearly shows the deer population is spreading. There are similar issues on the mainland with different states having different management approaches.\nThis problem is an interesting exercise in population modelling, and I cover the details below. But there are also scientific studies on the harvest rates required to stabilize deer populations. A study done in Tasmania estimated a rate of 25% of the population per year would be needed just to stabilise populations.\nGiven the estimate of 71,655 deer in 2024, that would equate to about 17,900 deer needing to be harvested each year just to stabilise the population. We’d need to harvest significantly more than that to reduce the population.\nI did some research but unfortunately couldn’t find any data on how many deer recreational hunters hunt or how many hunting licenses there are in Tasmania. But we can make some educated guesses. This study found that 28 hunters killed 128 deer over 3 years on one private reserve in Tasmania.\nThat amounts to about 1.5 deer per hunter per year. Thus, to harvest 17,900 deer per year would require about 11,933 hunters. That of course assumes the same success and participation rate. To get a substantial population decrease we’d need a much higher harvest rate, perhaps double that number of deer, meaning over 20,000 hunters would be needed.\nThis study sums it up nicely:\n” Wild deer populations in Australia and New Zealand are increasing and require active management to reduce their impacts on agriculture, natural values and human safety. It is sometimes suggested that recreational hunting, a popular activity in both countries, could be an effective tool for managing wild deer populations, but its effectiveness has seldom been demonstrated (Bengsen and Sparkes 2016). Our study showed that recreational hunting of fallow deer on a private reserve in Tasmania sustained a population density of 4–5 deer per km 2, higher than the average deer density in Tasmania. To effectively act as a control tool to reduce deer density, as proposed in the Tasmanian Wild Fallow Deer Management Plan 2022–27, recreational hunters would need to increase the number of deer killed annually well above 35% of the population, while targeting females primarily. This could be achieved by removing the ‘Partly Protected Wildlife’ status of fallow deer in Tasmania and its consequent restrictions on hunting seasons, quotas and shooting equipment (The Tasmanian Government 2023). Landholders can apply for special purposes wildlife property protection or crop protection permits to control deer on their properties, but completely removing that restriction, as was done in NSW (Bengsen and Forsyth 2019), would facilitate deer management on private land and most likely increase the annual deer harvest ”\nSource: https://doi.org/10.1111/emr.70001\nIt seems unlikely that Tasmania has that many active deer hunters that could be enabled by further removing restrictions. Other approaches such as professional culling and eradication by landholders will likely be required to achieve meaningful population reductions."

I recommend using the studies cited above for real advice on rates (as you’ll see I get quite different numbers).\nTasmania’s deer population has grown from about 53,660 to 71,655 individuals over 5 years (note there is errors around those numbers that we won’t consider here).\nPopulation growth is rarely linear. For the deer a reasonable approximation would be that deer are increasingly exponentially, meaning non-linearly at an increasing numbers of new animals each year. I make this assertion based the fact that their distribution is also growing, suggesting a growing population that is currently unhindered by environmental limits (e.g. food).\nFor growing populations its convenient to work with instantaneous rates of increase (r). r is a the rate of increase on a multiplicative (or ‘log’) scale. Let’s see how to do that.\n\nFinite rate of increase (λ)\nThe finite rate of increase over a time period is given by:\n\\[ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right)^{1/t} \\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(N_0 = 53,660\\) (initial population)\n\\(N_t = 71,655\\) (population after 5 years)\n\\(t = 5\\) years\n\nLet’s calculate this in R:\n\n\nShow the code\n# Initial parameters\nN0 &lt;- 53660  # Initial population\nNt &lt;- 71655  # Population after 5 years\nt &lt;- 5       # Time period in years\n\n# Calculate finite rate of increase\nlambda &lt;- (Nt / N0)^(1/t)\nlambda\n\n\n[1] 1.059544\n\n\n\n\nInstantaneous rate of increase (r)\nWe can convert λ to the instantaneous rate of increase using:\n\\[ r = \\ln(\\lambda) \\]\n\n\nShow the code\n# Calculate instantaneous rate of increase\nr &lt;- log(lambda)\nr\n\n\n[1] 0.05783902\n\n\nTo convince ourselves we’ve done the math right we can check the answer to see if we recover the original 5 year growth:\n\n\nShow the code\n53660 * exp(r*5)\n\n\n[1] 71655\n\n\nwhich equals the number of deer in 2024."

This means that the proportion of juveniles to adults remains constant, which may not be the case in a rapidly growing population.\nMore sophisticated models, like the one used in this study, would be needed to capture these dynamics accurately."
