  <title>Keeping enthusiasm about learning R</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-04-LLMs-coding-carbon-emissions/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Staying enthused about learning R is a challenge. You need progress from the initial motivation driven by ‘I need to learn this skill for my research career’ through a phase of tedium on your way to a competent R programmer.</p>
<p>Here’s my story.</p>
<section id="fitting-a-multinomial-peg-into-an-anova-hole" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fitting-a-multinomial-peg-into-an-anova-hole">Fitting a multinomial peg into an ANOVA hole</h2>
<p>I first attempted to learn R while wintering at a remote field station in the Southern Ocean. I had one book, 2004 satellite internet and a lot of time to kill.</p>
<p>Learning R was hard. Then you also have to learn statistics.</p>
<p>I had chosen a hard statistical question to start with. My colleague asked for help analysing data. The aim was to predict which of three behaviours flocks of birds would show under different situations. I was trying to wrangle ANOVA to do this analysis, because that is the method my book described.</p>
<p>I went around and around in circles. Were the behaviours factors or the response variable? If they were a response variable, how could the response have just three types of unordered outcomes? In hindsight I now see why I went in circles. The appropriate analysis would have been a multinomial model. Easy with <code>brms</code> (which didn’t exist then) or <code>mgcv</code>, but GLMs were not covered in standard text books in 2004, let alone multinomial GLMs.</p>
<p>I did however manage to learn how to code an ANOVA, as well as learning a bit about R code.</p>
<p>Coding requires us to be frustratingly precise in ways that human languages are not. This is hard for new programmers. And the learning curve for R is reknowned for being steeper than other coding languages.</p>
<p>The first step to competence is comprehending the exactness of programming.</p>

<section id="like-a-spoken-language-but-pedantic" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="like-a-spoken-language-but-pedantic">Like a spoken language, but pedantic</h2>
<p>After my misadventure in the Southern Ocean I studied evolutionary modelling for my Honours thesis. I used Matlab, a commercial product developed by a single company. Matlab has the major benefit of its consistency. Its functions are used in consistent ways, the help files have a consistent style.</p>
<p>R is open-source. ‘Learning R’ is an experience in trying to comprehend the thinking of scores of different open-source developers.</p>
<p>The <code>R is an ecosystem</code> cliche comes to mind. R is like a real ecosystem. The software ecosystem’s solutions to problems are diverse.</p>
<p>More often than someone has coded a solution to your problem in an R package. If only your could grasp how to use that solution the way its creator intended.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-structures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-structures">Data structures</h2>
<p>Undersanding data structures was a key insight…</p>
<p>Curiosity helps.</p>
<p>R has been my main science tool for over 20 years now.</p>
<p>As I gained more comprehension of R, stats in R became more like a puzzle. My own curiosity about what was possible kept me going. There is always something new to discover in a diverse software ecosystem.</p>
<p>At times the imperitive quickly became procrastination. I’ve spent too many late nights trying a new spatial or Bayesian stats package, just out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Twenty years on I often find it easier to code up with my own solutions to my research questions, rather than use someone else’s packaged solution. Its easier to comprehend a problem if you work through it yourself. Its easier to understand your own R style than someone else’s.</p>
<p>Many people learn R because they have to. It is hard to work in many fields of science without some programming skills.</p>
<p>Impact of genAI</p>
<p>Other people’s innovations add</p>
<p>Most data problems you come up with development statistical programmers</p>
<p>Always someting new to discover</p>
<p>There’s been turn-over too. Pipes and <code>tidyverse</code> changed everything. These packages made data wrangling and plotting so much easier.</p>
<p>Teaching R got easier. I could see 95% of my students checking out whenever I had to explain a cracker nested operation like <code>mean(log(subset(dat, grp == 'a')$x))</code></p>

  <title>Should we still teach R coding in this age of genAI?</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-02-should-we-teach-coding/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I often get asked if we should still be teaching coding skills to students and researchers now that we have generative AI tools that can write code for us.</p>
<p>The general consensus is yes, we should still teach coding. For an ecology specific <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14325">argument see here</a>.</p>
<p>Teaching coding is teaching people how to think logically and structure problems. These skills are essential not only in coding, but also for good science and problem solving in general.</p>
<p>So you need to learn to code to learn to think logically and structure problems.</p>
<p>A more practical standpoint is that LLMs are good at generating code that they have seen a lot of examples of in their data. But they are not so good at creative work on novel topics or niche areas.</p>
<p>For example, AI coding assistants struggle to make a simple <code>tmap</code> (the R mapping package) work well. <code>tmap</code> was updated recently, meaning the examples in the LLM’s training are out of date.</p>
<p>The coding assistants also seem to default to code patterns they are most familiar with, like <code>ggplot2</code> syntax. Not all of this works with <code>tmap</code>.</p>
<p>In general, I find they perform much better at statistical modelling in R than they do with complex geospatial analyses.</p>
<p>This practical issue may increasingly become less relevant as LLMs get better and we create better resources to inform their actions (like a tmap specific guide for LLMs to read before advising you, or web searches of the tmap page).</p>
<p>But it is still likely that frontier modelling will require deep human engagement with code. So learning to code is important for researchers.</p>
<p>I’ll leave the final say to Andrej Karpathy, former head of AI at Tesla and founding member of OpenAI’s research group.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy">recent podcast interview</a> he talks about a repo he made to help teach people how to work with LLMs. His advice to learners is literally to re-write his repo by hand, not even to cut and paste.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain that AI agents are good for very standard code or code that is common on the internet. But they perform poorly for creating new code, or code that contradicts common patterns.</p>
<p>For any research code he most commonly uses the code auto-complete features that AI assistants have, rather than AI agents.</p>
<p>He suggests that to really learn something you should code it yourself, using examples only as references.</p>
<p>Karpathy came up with the term ‘vibe-coding’ which means creating code by prompting, without reviewing the code. Usually an AI agent is used. So its saying a lot if he thinks that learning means doing it the old fashioned way of writing code yourself.</p>

  <title>Does data from protected areas help to improve ecolgoical forecasts? New pre-print</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-23-deer-harvest-reduction/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Sharing the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5647239">research work of my Master’s student, Leigha Aitken, that is now available as a pre-print</a>. She sought to answer the question:</p>
<p>Does data from protected areas help to improve ecological forecasts?</p>
<p>As a pre-print it is not peer-reviewed, though it has been examined and reviewed by UTas staff in thesis form and we did address those concerns. Abstract below, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5647239">full pdf on SSRN</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="abstract" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Models are increasingly used to make forecasts to support fisheries management by translating ecological theory into quantitative predictions. However, forecasts for fisheries species are often constrained by limited data from unfished reference conditions. No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) can provide insight into unfished population dynamics, potentially improving models’ predictive performance. This study asked whether incorporating NTMR data improves the accuracy of annual abundance forecasts over eight years. We compared the predictive performance of first-order autoregressive models that were trained on abundance data from either NTMR sites, fished sites, or a mix of both site types. Each model was then tested by predicting to sites it was not trained on (‘transferred’). We tested the forecasts for both fished and unfished species with 23 years of time-series abundance data from the Maria Island (Tasmania) NTMR and nearby control sites. We found a general decrease in the performance of fished and NTMR models when forecasts were transferred to the opposite site type. Model transferability was species-specific, with the NTMR model reducing forecasting errors by approximately 10% at fished sites for one sustainably fished species. In contrast, for other species, the fished model reduced forecast errors by approximately 4% and 56% at NTMR sites. Additionally, we found that models trained on a mix of site types consistently underperformed. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for site- and species-specific dynamics. While NTMR data offers valuable insights into unfished conditions, further work is required to create models that transfer well to any exploitation regime.</p>

  <title>Estimating harvest levels to reduce feral deer populations in Tasmania</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-23-deer-harvest-reduction copy/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Feral deer were introduced to Tasmania for hunting, but are becoming an increasing environmental, agricultural and road safety issue. They damage sensitive vegetation and even <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-10/seymour-wetland-tas-project-battles-deer/105156466">disrupt attempts to restore coastal wetlands</a>. A <a href="https://nre.tas.gov.au/Documents/The%202024%20aerial%20survey%20of%20fallow%20deer%20in%20Tasmania%20-%20summary%20report.pdf">recent report</a> shows results from a new survey indicating that the deer population is booming.</p>
<p>(Here’s a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-02/tas-new-feral-deer-survey-shows-population-boom/105843366">news article summarizing the report</a>).</p>
<p>I’m interested in the question how much harvesting is required to reduce deer populations. As a fisheries scientists, I’m usually asking the reverse question, of how much harvesting is too much. In this case, we want to overharest to reduce populations.</p>
<p>One suggestion from recreational hunting groups is to allow more hunting to control deer populations. But how much hunting would have to happen and is it feasible for recreational hunters to take that much?</p>
<p>The management problem is that deer in Tasmania are managed in zones, including sustainable hunting zones and no-go zones. The no-go zones are there to protect sennsitive enviroments, whereas the hunting zones are there to manage deer populations to allow ongoing recreational hunting.</p>
<p>But deer don’t obey jurisdictional boundaries and the new survey clearly shows the deer population is spreading. There are similar issues <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-17/sa-deer-eradication-program-aerial-culling-reduces-population/105763068">on the mainland with different states having different management approaches</a>.</p>
<p>This problem is an interesting exercise in population modelling, and I cover the details below. But there are also scientific studies on the harvest rates required to stabilize deer populations. A study done in Tasmania estimated a rate of <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.14546">25% of the population per year would be needed just to stabilise populations</a>.</p>
<p>Given the estimate of 71,655 deer in 2024, that would equate to about 17,900 deer needing to be harvested each year just to stabilise the population. We’d need to harvest significantly more than that to reduce the population.</p>
<p>I did some research but unfortunately couldn’t find any data on how many deer recreational hunters hunt or how many hunting licenses there are in Tasmania. But we can make some educated guesses. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/emr.70001">This study</a> found that 28 hunters killed 128 deer over 3 years on one private reserve in Tasmania.</p>
<p>That amounts to about 1.5 deer per hunter per year. Thus, to harvest 17,900 deer per year would require about 11,933 hunters. That of course assumes the same success and participation rate. To get a substantial population decrease we’d need a much higher harvest rate, perhaps double that number of deer, meaning over 20,000 hunters would be needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/emr.70001">This study sums it up nicely</a>:</p>
<p>” Wild deer populations in Australia and New Zealand <strong>are increasing and require active management</strong> to reduce their impacts on agriculture, natural values and human safety. It is sometimes suggested that recreational hunting, a popular activity in both countries, could be an effective tool for managing wild deer populations, but its effectiveness has seldom been demonstrated (Bengsen and Sparkes 2016). <strong>Our study showed that recreational hunting of fallow deer on a private reserve in Tasmania sustained a population density of 4–5 deer per km 2, higher than the average deer density in Tasmania</strong>. To effectively act as a control tool to reduce deer density, as proposed in the Tasmanian Wild Fallow Deer Management Plan 2022–27, recreational hunters would need to increase the number of deer killed annually well above 35% of the population, while targeting females primarily. <strong>This could be achieved by removing the ‘Partly Protected Wildlife’ status of fallow deer in Tasmania</strong> and its consequent restrictions on hunting seasons, quotas and shooting equipment (The Tasmanian Government 2023). Landholders can apply for special purposes wildlife property protection or crop protection permits to control deer on their properties, but completely removing that restriction, as was done in NSW (Bengsen and Forsyth 2019), would facilitate deer management on private land and most likely increase the annual deer harvest ”</p>
<p>Source: https://doi.org/10.1111/emr.70001</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Tasmania has that many active deer hunters that could be enabled by further removing restrictions. But more data on hunting participation is required to confirm or deny that claim.</p>
<p>Other approaches such as professional culling and eradication by landholders will likely be required to achieve meaningful population reductions.</p>
<section id="population-growth-calculations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="population-growth-calculations">Population growth calculations</h2>
<p>We can do our own simple calculations to estimate the harvest rate required to reduce deer populations. Note I provide below as an educational example only. I recommend using the studies cited above for real advice on rates (as you’ll see I get quite different numbers).</p>
<p>Tasmania’s deer population has grown from about 53,660 to 71,655 individuals over 5 years (note there is errors around those numbers that we won’t consider here).</p>
<p>Population growth is rarely linear. For the deer a reasonable approximation would be that deer are increasingly exponentially, meaning non-linearly at an increasing numbers of new animals each year. I make this assertion based the fact that their distribution is also growing, suggesting a growing population that is currently unhindered by environmental limits (e.g.&nbsp;food).</p>
<p>For growing populations its convenient to work with instantaneous rates of increase (<code>r</code>). <code>r</code> is a the rate of increase on a multiplicative (or ‘log’) scale. Let’s see how to do that.</p>
<section id="finite-rate-of-increase-λ" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finite-rate-of-increase-λ">Finite rate of increase (λ)</h3>
<p>The finite rate of increase over a time period is given by:</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to reduce the deer population from 71,655 back to 53,660 over 5 years.</p>
<p>To do this we need to calculate what harvest rate would achieve this while accounting for natural population growth.</p>
<p>The target is to have the net rate of change (growth minus harvest) result in the desired decline. We can set up the equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20N_t%20=%20N_0%20%5Ctimes%20e%5E%7B(r%20-%20h)%20%5Ctimes%20t%7D%20"></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"> is the harvest rate we want to solve for. Rearranging:</p>

<p>The plot clearly shows the diverging trajectories.</p>
<p>So why is my number of 12% per year so much lower than the 25% per year cited in the Tasmanian study?</p>
<p>For one, my calculation doesn’t account for the spatial dynamics and increasing range. Deer moving into new areas with fresh vegetation can sustain higher growth rates. For another my calculation assumes a stable age structure. This means that the proportion of juveniles to adults remains constant, which may not be the case in a rapidly growing population.</p>
<p>More sophisticated models, <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.14546">like the one used in this study</a>, would be needed to capture these dynamics accurately.</p>

  <title>Environmental impacts of large language models</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-22-environmental-impacts-LLMs/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just want to quickly highlight a few investigative blogs on the environmental impacts of LLMs.</p>
<p>There are two main issues: water use (for cooling servers) and carbon emissions generated by creating the hardware, training the models and then using the models to get responses (‘inference’).</p>
<p>This blog does a deep dive on the <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/the-ai-water-issue-is-fake">water issues</a>. The key finding is that the water issues seem to be overstated (he says ‘fake’ but I don’t agree with that word choice, water issues are real, just overstated).</p>
<p>Then academic Hannah Ritchies and author of ‘Sustainability by Numbers’ page sums up the <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/carbon-footprint-chatgpt">carbon cost of chatGPT</a>. She draws heavily on <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/a-few-meta-points-on-my-posts-on">Andy Masley</a> detailed work.</p>
<p>In particular, blog author (<a href="https://www.andymasley.com/">Andy Masley</a>) argues that the public has limited attention span for environmental issues and AI isn’t the biggest priority. He sums it up nicely:</p>
<p>“AI water use is mostly fake, personal prompt costs are mostly fake, but AI as a whole is going to put a huge strain on our electrical grid going forward that’s going to matter a lot for the green energy transition, local electricity prices, and air pollution”</p>
<p>By fake, he means your personal usage is trivially small. He highlights golf courses and streaming videos as much larger uses of water and emissions respectively.</p>
<p>What also matters is the counterfactual - ie what would you be doing if you weren’t using chatGPT? If you would be online shopping, using a microwave or streaming videos instead, then your personal emissions are probably slightly lower if you switch your time to chatGPT.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the impacts of your AI use you can easily do a personal offset by commiting to some simple behaviour changes. <a href="https://www.it.ox.ac.uk/article/reducing-energy-consumption-pcs">e.g.&nbsp;turn you computer off at night and turn it off at the power plug</a>.</p>
<section id="what-about-coders" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-coders">What about coders?</h2>
<p>One unaddressed question in these posts is the personal impacts of genAI power users (like me). By that I mean people using it for coding. The blogs above deal with people who are doing the occaisonal short chatGPT prompt. Coders might be leaning on AI hundreds of times a day for prompts that range from short to very long (and more energy intensive).</p>
<p>That’s something I’d like to do the numbers for later on.</p>

  <title>modelbased package for plotting interactions</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-21-modelbased/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been a big fan of the <code>visreg</code> package for a while, it makes it convenient to plot predictions from models. But recently I was struggling with a model that had many two-way interactions terms.</p>
<p>I checked out the key alternative to <code>visreg</code>, <code>ggeffects</code>, which is very popular (the paper has over 2000 citations). But the <code>ggeffects</code> page states it will be superseded by the <a href="(https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/)"><code>modelbased</code> package</a>. So here’s a quick demo of how to use <code>modelbased</code> to plot interaction effects from a GLM.</p>
<p><code>modelbased</code> is part of an ecosystem of packages for handling statistical models: <a href="https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/reference/estimate_slopes.html#references"><code>easystats</code></a>.</p>
<p>First I’m going to load data on coral cover and fish abundance from my <a href="https://github.com/cbrown5/example-ecological-data">Example ecological data</a> repo:</p>

<p>Now we’ll fit a simple poisson GLM. <code>pres.topa</code> is count of topa fish, a fish that likes to live in branching corals (<code>cb_cover</code>), and <code>logged</code> is a binary variable indicating whether the site was near to logging or not (which causes pollution that harms fish and corals).</p>

<p>One neat thing that <code>modelbased</code> does is give you different options for how to estimate marginal means. The default is “typical”, which estimates marginal means at the average value of numerical predictors and averages over frequencies of categorical predicotrs. But you can also do “average” which averages over sample distributions and “population” which attemps to create a counterfactual for all possible combinations of variables.</p>
<p>These answer different questions, see the <a href="https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/reference/estimate_means.html">documentation for more details</a>.</p>
<p>I’m going to make a dataframe of all three methods so we can compare them:</p>

<p>You can see see some key differences. The typical method shows effects of hard coral cover for a typical observation. There are slightly more unlogged than logged sites in the data:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb16" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">table</span>(dat<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">$</span>logged)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>
    Logged Not logged 
        21         28 </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>So the typical sample is different from a balanced population level average.</p>
<p>The population and typical predictions fall in between the predictions that are conditional on logging status, because both are kinds of averages over the two logging categories.</p>
<p>Predictions from the ‘average’ method show an inconsistent pattern, because they are averaging over samples. You can roughly see the trends for logged and unlogged sites.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s convince ourselves that the unbalanced data is causing these differences. I’m going to randomly remove some unlogged sites to create a balanced dataset, and refit the model:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb18" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

  <title>New online book AI Assistants for Scientific Coding</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-05-AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve released a new online book, <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/">AI Assistants for Scientific Coding</a>. It’s a practical guide to using language models to support scientific computing and analysis.</p>
<p>The book focuses on helping people who already use R or Python for data analysis. It’s not an introduction to programming; instead, it shows how to work with AI tools effectively and responsibly once you know the basics.</p>
<p>What you’ll find inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing and using AI coding assistants, from simple chat tools to agents that can run and test code</li>
<li>Prompting strategies that improve reliability for real analysis tasks</li>
<li>Examples from environmental science (GLMs, multivariate stats), with methods general to other fields</li>
<li>Notes on ethics, copyright, costs, and environmental impacts</li>
</ul>
<p>Read it here: https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/</p>
<p>The material also serves as reference notes for a one‑day workshop and will evolve as the field changes. If you’re interested in the prompting side of statistical workflows, there’s an accompanying preprint: https://doi.org/10.32942/X2CS80</p>

  <title>Automating the Github Copilot Agent from the command line with Copilot CLI</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-04-running-github-copilot-CLI-agents-from-R/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli">Github Copilot CLI (Command Line Interface)</a> recently became available. It is an AI agent, meaning it can use tools autonomously in a loop. It has two modes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>An interactive mode that is like a terminal version of the Copilot agent that runs in the chat window</p></li>
<li><p>A programmatic mode that can be run with shell scripts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Copilot CLI is available with paid versions of github copilot.</p>
<p>The programmatic mode interested me, because it allows you to write scripts that call github copilot agents. This means you could run replicate agents on the same problem, then gather there results for analysis.</p>
<p>I, of course, want to do everything from the R program, because I’m not great with unix code or Python. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli">Once you’ve setup the copilot CLI</a>, its very easy to run it from R:</p>
<pre><code>
copilot_cmd &lt;- "copilot -p 'Set-up this project directory with a readme.md file, and directories for outputs, scripts, plots.' --allow-all-tools"

system(copilot_cmd)
</code></pre>
<p>This will run the agent autonomously in the current working directory of your R session.</p>
<p>Now I wouldn’t recommend using <code>--allow-all-tools</code> like this however. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#security-considerations">There are important security considerations</a>. Like prompt injection attacks where an Agent goes on the web and gets tricked into doing something bad to your computer when it reads some malicious content. Likewise, agents can just stuff up and just delete or overwrite a bunch of files you wanted to keep.</p>
<p>You do need to allow some tools however, otherwise you might as well run the agent in interactive mode (because you’ll have to manually approve every tool use). This defeats the time-saving goal of running agents in a loop.</p>
<p>Here’s my current set-up:</p>
<p><code>copilot -p 'A prompt here' --allow-all-tools --deny-tool 'shell(cd)' --deny-tool 'shell(git)' --deny-tool 'shell(pwd)' --deny-tool 'fetch' --deny-tool 'extensions' --deny-tool 'websearch' --deny-tool 'githubRepo'"</code></p>
<p>I allow all tools, then prevent tools related to changing working directory, accessing the web or viewing directory context.</p>
<p>There is still some risk here. e.g., if you want it to run Rscripts you might want to include in your prompt something like ‘Use <code>Rscript my-script.R</code> to run R scripts from the terminal.’ The R scripts could include anything (including connecting to the web).</p>
<p>Here’s an example in action. I use sprintf to format the terminal command with the prompt, tools and sub-directory path.</p>
<pre><code>copilot_prompt &lt;- "Set-up this project directory with a readme.md file, and directories for outputs, scripts, plots. Then create example data to illustrate a poisson GLM. Make prediction plots. Use `Rscript 'my-script.R'` to run R files. "

copilot_tools &lt;- "--allow-all-tools --deny-tool 'shell(cd)' --deny-tool 'shell(git)' --deny-tool 'shell(pwd)' --deny-tool 'fetch' --deny-tool 'extensions' --deny-tool 'websearch' --deny-tool 'githubRepo'"

subdir_path &lt;- "dir1"

 copilot_cmd &lt;- sprintf(
    "cd '%s' &amp;&amp; copilot -p '%s' %s",
    subdir_path,
    copilot_prompt,
    copilot_tools
  )

system(copilot_cmd)
</code></pre>
<p>From here it would be easy to create a loop over different subdirectory paths, and run a separate agent in each one. The advantage of <code>cd</code>ing into each path before the agent opens is that the agent can’t then see context from other sub-directories. So you get independent agent runs.</p>
<p>You could use this to see how different prompts perform, or do complex prompt strategies like ‘tree of thought’. In tree of thought you ask an agent to create the same thing many times, it will do it slightly differently each time. Then you aggregate the results and pick the most common or most accurate one.</p>
<p>My one gripe is that Github have provided us with woeful documentation of what the tool names are. I’m guessing the tools are what you can see if you open the chat window, click ‘Agent’ mode, then click the tool symbol.</p>
<p>I’d love to have some default tool sets that simplify the tool permissions. For instance a tool set that locks down all web access.</p>

  <title>Planning an effective workshop</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-02-running-an-effective-workshop/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week in lab meeting we discussed planning a workshop. Here are a few notes of pointers that came up in the discussion.</p>
<p>Be clear on your goals for the workshop. And communicate those goals to the participants.</p>
<p>Invite the right people.</p>
<p>Think about what’s in it for them and communicate that in your invitation but also in follow-up communication. - Interesting places - Networking - Opportunity to collaborate - Opportunity to promote their own work</p>
<p>Think about what knowledge workshops participants need that they don’t currently have. This is particularly important if your workshop participants come from different disciplines.</p>
<p>You’ll need to plan to balance the delivery of essential information and the discussion to develop new ideas and obtain information from the group. For instance, what background info that is needed to participate effectively? What can individuals contribute? What synergies do you hope to get out of group discussions? (and making sure those people have the opportunity to talk together in the workshop).</p>
<section id="roles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="roles">Roles</h2>
<p>For each workshop you should designate a facilitator and a note keeper. These should be different people. See also <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2025/08/21/quick-tips-for-faciltating-meetings.html">our blog on facilitating meetings</a></p>
<p>Facilitation takes practice and its good to have someone experienced in this role.</p>
<p>You also need a plan to capture information from the workshop. So make sure you have a note taking system (e.g.&nbsp;online docs, charts on butcher’s paper) and someone who is going to chase those up from the group. Break-out groups are great, but make sure you have a way to capture their ideas.</p>
</section>
<section id="icebreakers-and-team-bonding" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="icebreakers-and-team-bonding">Icebreakers and team bonding</h2>
<p>You can send a form in advance asking a few questions about people’s backgrounds, as well as 1 or 2 questions about them as a person. Here’s some ideas - What is your area of research? - What paper or research product are you most proud of? - What are you hoping to get out of this workshop? - What is your favourite sport or hobby?</p>
<p>Plan an activity or activities to help people bond. One example is showing people a picture of a cloud. Then asking them to draw what they see in the cloud and share that with people nearby. Helps get people engaged in the workshop as well as understand that everyone has a different perspective. There are many different examples of these types of group bonding activities.</p>
<p>Another is ‘four corners’ or ‘two-sides’. Ask people to sort themselves in the room based on their preferences (keeping it non-political and light hearted). e.g.&nbsp;“Do you like mushrooms?”, “Do you like pineapple on pizza?”, “Are you an experimental, field or modelling scientist?”, …</p>
</section>
<section id="workshop-activities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workshop-activities">Workshop activities</h2>
<p>Strongly recommend using break-out groups, especially if you have more than 6 people at your workshop. This maximises engagement with the whole group and gives quieter voices a chance to speak up.</p>
<p>Think about the balance of plenary time (everyone together) and break out groups. A typical structure would be:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="registration"><a href="https://payments.utas.edu.au/Register/booking?UDS_ACTION=S1I&amp;UDS_ACTION_DATA=bFAgA0dNWAFOKFdyNEJDBShXQg1KKE0bKUcyXAE1VDR7NVtc">Registration</a></h2>
<p>The R program is a powerful tool for data analysis, but has a steep learning curve. Join us for a 2-day workshop that will accelerate your R skills. Our modern approach to teaching leverages AI to help you create analyses with natural language, and code with fewer errors, but higher accuracy.</p>
<p>Presenter: A/Prof Chris J Brown c.j.brown@utas.edu.au Guest presenter: Professor Anthony Richardson, The University of Queensland and CSIRO Environment</p>
<p>Cost per day: $200 students, $300 professionals. Waiver available for indigenous scholars. Register for 1 or 2 days.</p>
</section>
<section id="day-1-11th-nov-quality-data-analysis-with-ai-coding-assistants" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="day-1-11th-nov-quality-data-analysis-with-ai-coding-assistants">Day 1 (11th Nov): Quality data analysis with AI coding assistants</h2>
<p>Suitable for R or Python users**. We’ll show you how to use large language models (like chatGPT) directly in your R or Python coding environment. You can accelerate your coding and get personalised help on your research. But there are risks, AI makes mistakes. We’ve developed guidelines to help you get the most out of AI for coding. We’ll also discuss the ethical implications of using AI to assist with research and whether ‘vibe coding’ is appropriate for scientists. This workshop is suitable for people with limited coding experience (e.g.&nbsp;can read data into Rstudio and make plots) as well as experts who want to know more about AI assistants.</p>
</section>
<section id="day-2-12th-nov-generalized-linear-models-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="day-2-12th-nov-generalized-linear-models-in-r">Day 2 (12th Nov): Generalized linear models (in R**)</h2>
<p>GLMs are a powerful tool for statistical analysis and prediction. We’ll teach the basics of the linear model and how it can be extended to all sorts of data in the generalized linear model. We’ll cover model verification, estimating effect size and significance and making predictions. The beauty of GLMs is that you only need some basic principles and you are ready to tackle many types of data, not like the old days when you had to know a different test for each new type of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be additional subscription costs for AI software of up to USD20. Students can get free licenses. I will email instructions for getting software licenses prior to the workshops.</li>
</ul>
<p>**Note these workshops are not suitable for coding beginners. If you’ve never used R or Python before we suggest you take an introductory workshop. IMAS runs one, feel free to contact us for more info on that. As a rule of thumb, if you have Rstudio, know how to read data into R and make some plots you are ready for these workshops.</p>

  <title>AI generated scicomm games</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-09-17-ai-generated-scicomm-games/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week I ran a talk and workshop for the Tasmanian Student Science Communicators Network.</p>
<p>The workshop was about creating gamifying learning. So I thought it would be fun to design some games then create them live as web apps using an AI agent.</p>
<p>The particpants designed games on a piece of paper. The aim was to communicate different concepts about sustainable management of fisheries through a game.</p>
<p>I then took the images and a simple description of game play and plugged it into the Roo Code AI agent.</p>
<p>Here’s the results, they are simple html and javascript based games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the workshop participants for generously contributing their ideas.</p>
<p>Here’s the links to the games and the game rules (which incidentally are also the prompts I used)</p>
<section id="fish-in-a-pond" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fish-in-a-pond"><a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/data/tassie-scicomm-games/fish-in-a-pond/">Fish in a pond</a></h2>
<p>In this game the player is working to replenish the fish population and racing a truck that is taking fish out of the ocean.</p>
<p>The ocean is the top bucket.</p>
<p>The bottom bucket is like candy candy crush. The player is trying to match four symbols. Every time they match a symbol new fish are born and top-up the fish in the ocean.</p>
<p>The game ends if the the ocean runs out of fish. If the player gets the fish over 80% full then the truck speeds up.</p>
</section>
<section id="fish-crush" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fish-crush"><a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/data/tassie-scicomm-games/fish-crush/">Fish crush</a></h2>
<p>In this game the player is to make a large amount of money. They are working to look after fish in a pond, then they catch the fish to make money.</p>
<p>They are aiming to keep the pond at about 50% full and have a profitable fishery.</p>
<p>They have to look after the environment around the pond so the fish are healthy. This means preventing pollution and making sure the water is good.</p>
<p>They can catch fish to make money. If they catch too many fish the population collapses.</p>
<p>Winning the game should require looking after the environment around the pond. It should also require catching fish at a slow steady rate, not too much, not too litte.</p>

  <title>Projecting Uncertainty in Ecosystem Persistence Under Climate Change</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-09-13-projecting-uncertainty-ecosystem-persistence/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Rising seas and coastal development are pushing mangrove forests beyond their historical limits. Predicting how these critical ecosystems will respond is much harder when environmental change is unprecedented. In a new study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70468">Projecting Uncertainty in Ecosystem Persistence Under Climate Change</a>, we show how to estimate the probability that mangrove forests will persist or decline worldwide.</p>
<p>Good predictions of ecosystem persistence are essential for coastal protection, fisheries management and climate-smart conservation planning.</p>
<p>The problem is that traditional models require detailed data that doesn’t exist at global scales. Models predict best when conditions match their training data. Climate change means mangroves face conditions they’ve never experienced before.</p>
<p>We developed a method to estimate probabilities of mangrove persistence using global datasets. This gives us a way to measure uncertainty that we can use to guide conservation decisions, e.g.&nbsp;to identify where management actions are most likely to succeed.</p>
<p>We used network models to analyze how mangroves respond at both their seaward and landward edges. Mangroves are unique because they can potentially expand in both directions as seas rise - landward into newly flooded areas, or seaward by trapping sediment.</p>
<p>Here’s the projections for persistence of mangroves as they are currently (ie without any loss) from one of our scenarios:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-09-13-projecting-uncertainty-ecosystem-persistence/Buelow_etal2025-graphical-abstract.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Our models reveal a stark contrast. 77% of mangrove units worldwide are likely to lose area at their seaward edge by 2040-2060. Rising seas, storms and reduced sediment from dammed rivers create multiple pressures. In contrast, about 30% of units could gain area landward, but coastal development often blocks this migration.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, uncertainty is high. In more than half the mangrove units studied, we couldn’t predict whether forests would persist or decline - the probability was essentially random. This isn’t a model failure. It tells us where better data and management actions could tip the balance.</p>
<p>Geographic patterns emerged clearly. Mangroves in areas with small tidal ranges face greater risks. Sediment-rich coastlines offer better prospects for seaward expansion. Areas with dense coastal populations face the greatest landward migration challenges.</p>
<p>We tested conservation scenarios and found encouraging results. With targeted management - sediment addition, barrier removal, and assisted migration - the number of units likely to persist could nearly double.</p>
<p>This research shows a new way to handle ecosystem predictions under climate change. Instead of false precision, we quantify what we know and don’t know. For mangroves, significant seaward losses are likely, but landward gains and conservation success remain possible with strategic action.

  <title>Paper in a prompt creating a first draft in one prompt</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-09-12-creating-a-first-draft-in-one-prompt/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>*It was a rather long prompt</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could get an AI agent to complete a first draft of a paper, including data analysis, searching for references on the web and writing a complete draft.</p>
<p>I used the Roo Code agent software with the Claude Sonnet 4.0 large language model.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/data/ai-generated-manuscript">I’ve shared the results from replicate 1 here</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also pasted the abstracts from the two replicates below. Both used identical prompts and settings in Roo Code. Its interesting how they are different. For instance the first one frames the study in terms of estimating the scale of human impacts. The second frames the study as being about studying an under-studied mechanism.</p>
<p>The experiment started with a project folder with data and detailed instructions for the research question, the data and the analyses I wanted. The instructions included details of R packages and specific statistics, for instance I told the model to use Bray-Curtis distances for the multivariate analysis.</p>
<p>I also provided basic instructions for how to write the paper. The agent had web search capabilities, allowing it to access , and read real references, and then incorporate insights from those into the paper.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this draft has not been edited by a human. Parts of it are not scientifically accurate. It should not be read as anything other than an experiment. It contains errors and some of the references are false.</p>
<p>For instance, it made up the following reference, but oddly linked it to a real reference (that is different) using a real DOI:</p>
<p>Hamilton, Richard J et al.&nbsp;2025. “Modeling Sediment Impacts on Juvenile Reef Fish.” Frontiers in Marine Science. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2025.1513498.</p>
<p>It didn’t make much of an effort to create good instructions for writing a paper. I’m sure you could do a lot better than this with more careful prompting.</p>
<p>AI generated papers should never replace human oversight. If you rely solely on AI, you miss the chance to truly understand your subject. Science is about learning, not just producing content.</p>
<p>What this sort of thing could be useful for is as a way to iterate and quickly explore alternative options for how to write a paper, or explore alternative interpretations.</p>
<p>It can also help you get over ‘the fear of the white page’ (writers block), by giving you something to start editing.</p>
<section id="abstract-from-replicate-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-from-replicate-1">Abstract from replicate 1</h2>
<p>Terrestrial logging threatens coral reef ecosystems through increased sedimentation, yet the spatial patterns of impact remain poorly understood. We examined benthic community composition at 49 coral reef sites across a gradient of logging impacts in Kia Province, Solomon Islands, spanning distances from 0.20 to 22.4 km from logging operations. Using multidimensional scaling ordination and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we tested for differences in community structure between logged and not logged sites and across distance categories. Benthic communities differed significantly between logged and not logged sites (PERMANOVA p = 0.027), with logged sites showing 14.2% lower coral cover (48.0% vs 62.2%). Distance-dependent effects were highly significant (p = 0.002), explaining 11.9% of community variance. Sites within 1 km of logging showed severely degraded conditions (31.2% coral cover, 33.3% sand cover), while sites beyond 10 km maintained high coral cover (62.9%). Recovery followed a clear gradient: moderate distance sites (1-3 km) had 55.3% coral cover, far sites (3-10 km) had 60.4% coral cover. Categorical distance analysis proved more informative than continuous distance relationships, indicating threshold effects rather than linear gradients. These findings demonstrate that logging impacts extend further than previously documented, with measurable effects at sites 1-3 km from operations. Our results provide quantitative evidence for establishing buffer zones around coral reefs and highlight the need for watershed-scale conservation planning that integrates terrestrial forest management with marine protected area design.</p>

<section id="abstract-from-replicate-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-from-replicate-2">Abstract from replicate 2</h2>
<p>Coral reef ecosystems face increasing threats from terrestrial activities, with logging-induced sedimentation representing a significant but understudied impact mechanism. This study examined benthic community structure across 49 coral reef sites in the Solomon Islands using multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination to test the hypothesis that logging activities influence reef community composition through sedimentation. We applied non-metric multidimensional scaling to benthic cover data using both Euclidean and Bray-Curtis distance metrics, with environmental vector fitting to identify ecological gradients. The analysis revealed strong community gradients primarily associated with coral branching cover (r² = 0.82) and soft coral cover (r² = 0.62), while water clarity showed moderate correlation (r² = 0.24) with community structure. Contrary to expectations, distance to logging showed weak correlation with community patterns (r² = 0.056, p = 0.101), suggesting that logging impacts operate through pathways not captured by simple proximity measures. The results demonstrate MDS ordination effectiveness for revealing coral community structure patterns while highlighting the complexity of logging-reef relationships in tropical marine systems.</p>

  <title>AI aided note taking</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-09-05-AI-aided-note-taking/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This is my favourite workflow for note taking at the moment:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Voice record my thoughts to iphone with the recording app. I don’t take much care to speak clearly or in a structured way. I just blurt all my thoughts out into the recorder.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the transcript button and copy the text</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Then I either do:</p>
<p>3a. Paste into Copilot for Teams and prompt <code>Clean up this voice recording and organize it into notes that are arranged in a logical order. Use markdown format</code></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>3b. Paste into Teams chat to myself for later. Later on my laptop paste the text into a markdown document and use Roo Code or Github Copilot with <code>Clean up this voice recording and organize it into notes that are arranged in a logical order. Use markdown format</code></p>
<p>In general I’m not a fan of AI note taking. The problem is if you take a document you didn’t write and then get AI to summarize it for you there is no mental energy. The mental energy is when you learn and synthesize ideas.</p>
<p>However, I feel differently about voice recordings, because the ideas are still going via my brain before they get to the AI. It also allows me to capture complex ideas that I may not get time to write down.</p>
<p>For example, I’ve used it while cleaning the house to get a blog idea down and then into a first draft. I used it while walking to an appointment to ‘write’ a first draft of the methods for a paper.</p>

  <title>Making the jump from PhD to Postdoc</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-09-04-making-the-jump-from-phd-to-postdoc copy/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In our lab meeting today we talked about the transition from a PhD to a postdoc position. I’m sharing some of the advice from the lab and reflections here.</p>
<p>Thanks to Seascapes and CAT labs for sharing their thoughts.</p>
<p>This can be a hard transition to make. At the end of your PhD you should have a good level of confidence about your topic. But then a postdoc position will often be on a different research problem, use different methods or be working with a different network of scientists and stakeholders.</p>
<section id="tips-to-prepare-for-the-transition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tips-to-prepare-for-the-transition">Tips to prepare for the transition</h2>
<section id="metacognition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metacognition">Metacognition</h3>
<p>Metacognition is self-awareness of your thought processes. For research its particularly key to be self-aware of how you learn.</p>
<p>Understanding how to learn means you can quickly and more smoothly immerse yourself in a new research topic.</p>
<p>For PhD supervisors you can point out or ask questions to help students understand their own thought and learning processes. For example, one metacognition trick is to use analogy to solve a new problem.</p>
<p>Another skill is understanding how you learn (is it by reading, by talking to people, by doing? ). This can help you come to grips with a new topic if you know how to research it and what is the best way that works for you.</p>
<p>Exposing yourself to a broad range of different types of research (for me this meant attending the biology department seminar which ranged from fisheries topics I was interested in to neuroscience which could still be interesting though not directly relevant to my studies then).</p>
</section>
<section id="presentation-and-communication-skills" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="presentation-and-communication-skills">Presentation and communication skills</h3>
<p>These skills are just broadly useful in many careers and easy to translate.</p>
<p>Its one reason we practice <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2025/08/21/quick-tips-for-faciltating-meetings.html">facilitation of meetings</a> in our lab meetings.</p>
<p>Things to think about in your PhD (or for supervisors) are to get a broad view on different ways of presenting information. Sometimes our PhDs are too focused on academic publications and presentations.</p>
<p>Read, and look for opportunities to write in other formats such as blogs, media releases, reports and policy briefs.</p>
<p>For presentations, take comms training (if its available), do media interviews if you get the chance. Participating in 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) is another great way to learn presentation skills that are highly transferable.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-who-matters-and-who-you-report-to" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-who-matters-and-who-you-report-to">Learning who matters and who you report to</h3>
<p>Lots of people will give you advice or directions. Some of it is good, some not so good. Understanding of reporting structures in your organisation is important so you can understand your role and what the organisation wants you to achieve.</p>
<p>In your postdoc you may have less autonomy in some ways than you had in your PhD. Often postdocs are funded to deliver a certain project outcome (e.g.&nbsp;for industry partner or government).</p>
<p>This will mean you need to better differentiate between helpful advisors and project leaders that you need to deliver too.</p>
<p>As you progress in your career its also important to learn more about institutional structures. For instance, your supervisor might report to a head of school who reports to a dean who reports to a pro-vice chancellor. You probably didn’t pay too much attention to this stuff in your PhD.</p>
<p>It becomes increasingly important to understand as you move up in your career.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="making-the-transition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-the-transition">Making the transition</h2>
<section id="knowing-how-to-get-help" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="knowing-how-to-get-help">Knowing how to get help</h3>
<p>Find out how to get help and don’t be afraid to ask. Your new colleagues are usually happy to help.</p>
<p>It could be small things like how to navigate the financial reimbursement system. This can save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>Most universities and large institutions will also provide access to counselling and mental health care services, so take make the most of those if you are finding the new job or move stressful.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-a-new-topic" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-a-new-topic">Learning a new topic</h3>
<p>Don’t underestimate the time it takes to learn a new topic. So give yourself (and talk to your supervisor about having) time to learn the new topic.</p>
<p>And the final tip from the team was to read old papers, from 10, 20, 30 years ago or more. When you are approaching a new topic these papers give you essential background and are often simpler to understand. Its also helpful to understand the historical context of a new research field.</p>

  <title>Create reports and tutorials with generative AI from R</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-09-02-AI-reports-with-openrouter-and-r/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Several AI model providers have integrated web search capabilities into their large language models. I was attempting to use these features via the R <code>ellmer</code> package. However, changes to LLMs are so frequent that <code>ellmer</code> isn’t keeping up.</p>
<p>I did get <code>ellmer</code> to run Perplexity’s Sonar web search model, however it didn’t provide me with the references, which are essential.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen these AI generated reports, check out the example at the end. Its a useful way to get a quick literature summary or create bespoke R tutorials.</p>
<p>Here <a href="https://github.com/cbrown5/web-search-ai/blob/main/README.md">I’m just announcing a couple of simple R scripts that you can use to do web search powered AI reports with the Openrouter service.</a></p>
<p>I just created two functions (with the help of copilot of course), one that makes a call to the Openrouter API to send a question to a model. The second function processes the output (which is in JSON format) to make a nice qmd, with the references hyper-linked (be sure to check the url before clicking them, who knows what the AI will turn up!). From there you can render the qmd to get a pdf/word/html report.</p>
<p>The functions are easy to use. First <a href="https://github.com/cbrown5/web-search-ai/blob/main/perplexity-search-functions.R">download or copy these functions from my github</a>.</p>
<p>Note never trust any code from someone else that sends requests to LLMs! It could potentially include harmful prompts. I recommend reading all code that is sending prompts to LLMs just to be sure you know what it does.</p>
<section id="using-the-code-to-do-a-search-and-create-a-report" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-the-code-to-do-a-search-and-create-a-report">Using the code to do a search and create a report</h2>
<p>Once you have my two functions, you will need to <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/03-set-up.html#sec-apikeys">set-up your Openrouter API key</a> and save the key somewhere (e.g.&nbsp;you can use <code>usethis::edit_r_environ()</code> and save it in there like OPENROUTER_API_KEY=“MY-KEY-HERE”)</p>
<p>Here’s an example of using the function:</p>
<pre><code>library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

source("perplexity-search-functions.R")

openrouter_api_key &lt;- Sys.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")

user_message &lt;- "I want to learn how to use the NIMBLE package to fit autoregressive time-series models"

system_message &lt;- "You are a helpful AI agent who creates statistical analysis tutorials in R. 
        Rules: 
        1. Include text and examples of code in your responses. 
        2. Produce reports that are less than 10000 words."

#Send response to openrouter 
response &lt;- call_openrouter_api(
  openrouter_api_key,
  model = "perplexity/sonar-deep-research",
  system_message = system_message,
  user_message,
  search_context_size = "medium"
  #Options "low"  "medium", "high"
)

#Save the response as a qmd
save_response_as_qmd(response, "results/AR-models-in-NIMBLE.qmd")</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="inputs-for-the-llm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inputs-for-the-llm">Inputs for the LLM</h2>
<p>The user message is your prompt for searching. The system message sets the scope of how the report is created. Note that anything for the web search goes in the user message, not the system message <a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/prompt-guide">see the Perplexity guidelines for more info on prompting advice, its different than for regular LLMs</a>.</p>
<p>For example, another idea for a system prompt could be:</p>
<pre><code>system_message &lt;- "You are a helpful AI agent who creates summary reports of the scientific literature. 
        Rules: 
        1. Produce reports that are less than 2000 words.
        2. Include a Summary section that summarizes key research trends. "

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customization">Customization</h2>
<p>The <code>call_openrouter_api.R</code> function is a template for customizing, not a comprehensive framework for using the openrouter API. Its actually very easy to connect to LLMs from R (even though most examples online are in python or typscript). Here’s a basic template:</p>
<pre><code>library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
response &lt;- POST(
    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    add_headers(
      "Content-Type" = "application/json",
      "Authorization" = paste("Bearer", openrouter_api_key)
    ),
    body = toJSON(list(
      model = model,
      messages = list(
        list(
          role = "system",
          content = system_message
        ),  
        list(
          role = "user",
          content = user_message
        )
      )
    ), auto_unbox = TRUE),
    encode = "raw"
  )
</code></pre>
<p>The trick then is formatting the output, which is what my other function does (focussing on perplexities models).</p>

<p>Below is an example, I asked used the system prompt above and asked about fitting surplus production models (for fisheries science) with the NIMBLE package. Note one minor bug with my function converting qmd references to hyperlinks, it potential does R sub-scripts as well. Something to work on later. Here’s the AI report:</p>
<p>You can fit a <strong>surplus production model (SPM)</strong> with the NIMBLE package in R by writing the model in BUGS language, which NIMBLE extends, specifying your likelihood (e.g., production dynamics with catch data) and priors for the parameters, and then using NIMBLE’s MCMC capabilities to estimate the posterior distributions of parameters. Here is a stepwise approach with example code snippets:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Specify the surplus production model in BUGS code</strong>:<br>
This typically models biomass ( B_t ) evolving over time according to a logistic growth or Gompertz model minus catches ( C_t ). For example, the Schaefer model can be expressed as:<br>
[ B_{t+1} = B_t + r B_t (1 - ) - C_t + _t ]<br>
where (r) is intrinsic growth rate, (K) is carrying capacity, and (_t) models process noise.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>library(nimble)

# Define the model in BUGS syntax
spm_code &lt;- nimbleCode({
  # Priors for parameters
  r ~ dunif(0, 2)           # growth rate
  K ~ dunif(maxCatch, 10 * maxCatch)  # carrying capacity (expand as appropriate)
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 5)       # process noise SD

  B&lt;a href="https://oliviergimenez.github.io/banana-book/intronimble.html" target="_blank"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; ~ dunif(0, K)       # initial biomass
  
  for(t in 1:(nYears - 1)) {
    mu[t] &lt;- B[t] + r * B[t] * (1 - B[t]/K) - catch[t]
    B[t + 1] ~ dnorm(mu[t], sd = sigma)
  }
})</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Prepare the data and constants</strong> (e.g., catch time series, number of years):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>data &lt;- list(catch = catch_vector)  # your observed catches
constants &lt;- list(nYears = length(catch_vector), maxCatch = max(catch_vector))
inits &lt;- list(r = 0.5, K = max(catch_vector)*5, sigma = 0.1, B = rep(NA, length(catch_vector)))</code></pre>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Build, compile, and run the model with NIMBLE</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code># Create model object
spm_model &lt;- nimbleModel(spm_code, data = data, inits = inits, constants = constants)

# Compile model
c_spm_model &lt;- compileNimble(spm_model)

# Configure MCMC; default samplers are usually fine
mcmc_conf &lt;- configureMCMC(spm_model)
mcmc &lt;- buildMCMC(mcmc_conf)
c_mcmc &lt;- compileNimble(mcmc, project = spm_model)

# Run MCMC sampling
samples &lt;- runMCMC(c_mcmc, niter = 10000, nburnin = 2000, thin = 5)

# Check results
summary(samples)</code></pre>
<p>This workflow follows NIMBLE’s general approach of specifying hierarchical Bayesian models in an extended BUGS language, compiling fast C++ versions of the model and samplers, and running MCMC algorithms<a href="https://oliviergimenez.github.io/banana-book/intronimble.html" target="_blank">[1]</a><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/nimble/versions/1.3.0/topics/nimble-package" target="_blank">[2]</a><a href="https://github.com/nimble-dev/nimble" target="_blank">[4]</a><a href="https://r-nimble.org" target="_blank">[7]</a>. The key is coding the surplus production dynamics explicitly as state-transition equations with observation or process error as needed.</p>
<p>For clarity, here is a <strong>minimal example with dummy catch data</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>library(nimble)

catch_vector &lt;- c(100, 120, 90, 80, 110) # example catches

spm_code &lt;- nimbleCode({
  r ~ dunif(0, 2)
  K ~ dunif(maxCatch, 10 * maxCatch)
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 5)

  B&lt;a href="https://oliviergimenez.github.io/banana-book/intronimble.html" target="_blank"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; ~ dunif(0, K)
  for(t in 1:(nYears - 1)) {
    mu[t] &lt;- B[t] + r * B[t] * (1 - B[t]/K) - catch[t]
    B[t+1] ~ dnorm(mu[t], sd = sigma)
  }
})

data &lt;- list(catch = catch_vector)
constants &lt;- list(nYears = length(catch_vector), maxCatch = max(catch_vector))
inits &lt;- list(r = 0.5, K = max(catch_vector)*5, sigma = 0.1, B = rep(NA, length(catch_vector)))

spm_model &lt;- nimbleModel(spm_code, data = data, inits = inits, constants = constants)
c_spm_model &lt;- compileNimble(spm_model)

mcmc_conf &lt;- configureMCMC(spm_model)
mcmc &lt;- buildMCMC(mcmc_conf)
c_mcmc &lt;- compileNimble(mcmc, project = spm_model)

samples &lt;- runMCMC(c_mcmc, niter = 5000, nburnin = 1000, thin = 2)
print(summary(samples))</code></pre>
<p>This example models biomass dynamics probabilistically and fits parameters (r), (K), and noise level () given known catches using Bayesian inference.</p>
<p>If you want to implement maximum likelihood fitting instead, NIMBLE lets you compile the model and evaluate likelihoods for optimization, as demonstrated in tutorials<a href="https://oliviergimenez.github.io/banana-book/intronimble.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In summary: - <strong>Write your surplus production model in NIMBLE’s BUGS language</strong>, defining biomass dynamics, catch, and priors for parameters<br>
- <strong>Compile and run MCMC</strong> sampling in NIMBLE to fit the model<br>
- <strong>Extract posterior samples</strong> for growth rate, carrying capacity, biomass, and uncertainty<br>
- Optionally, use <strong>likelihood-based methods</strong> by compiling the model and defining your own optimizer function in R<a href="https://oliviergimenez.github.io/banana-book/intronimble.html" target="_blank">[1]</a><a href="https://r-nimble.org" target="_blank">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>This approach leverages NIMBLE’s power for hierarchical, Bayesian time-series stock assessment models including surplus production models.</p>
