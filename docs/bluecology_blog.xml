  <title>Rethinking ecological predictions and uncertainty</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-16-rethinking-ecological-predictions-and-uncertainty/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Ecological modelling is a science geared towards predicting change in ecosystems. But I think for many ecosystems we’ve been going about making predictions the wrong way. We are overlooking how slight changes in feedbacks within ecosystems can lead to runaway outcomes far beyond what we anticipated.</p>
<p>Consequently, we have too much confidence in our ability to build models that predict well.</p>
<p>An alternative way to predict change is to acknowledge and then try to represent high levels of uncertainty in ecological feedback processes. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70468">Qualitative models are one way to do this</a>.</p>
<section id="types-of-ecological-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-ecological-models">Types of ecological models</h2>
<p>Increasingly sophisticated models of ecological mechanisms are being used to make predictions ecological change and support challenging management problems like climate change.</p>
<p>One example are the global forest models that are used to predict carbon sequestration from the atmosphere by the world’s forests for the next 50-100 years. Predicting carbon sequestration is essential as it is one part of estimating future atmospheric carbon dioxide, an essential component of the global climate models that predict how much our world will warm.</p>
<p>Statistical models and machine learning are also key areas of innovation. These models tend to focus on describing patterns, over mechanistic detail of the model formulation (though there are exceptions of course). Much effort is invested in developing models that make use of data to capture multiple sources of uncertainty and describe non-linear relationships.</p>
<p>A leading example are the species distribution models that predict where species occur in space. This information is essential for a range of applications, including protected area design, threatened species management and managing species responses to climate change.</p>
<p>What the statistical models that focus on patterns and the mechanistic models share in common is a focus on quantitative predictions. That is, making precise predictions of how much - how much forest, how much carbon, probability of species occurrence and how many species.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-were-missing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-were-missing">What we’re missing</h2>
<p>The focus on quantitative predictions puts a lot of faith in our ability to build useful models. For mechanistic models the faith is that we have enough knowledge to know which equations are important. For the statistical and machine learning models the faith is that the data can reveal the important insights.</p>
<p>But what if uncertainty about ecological futures is much greater than we ecologists typically acknowledge?</p>
<p>One example is that marine scientists were totally blindsided by <a href="https://theconversation.com/like-an-underwater-bushfire-sas-marine-algal-bloom-is-still-killing-almost-everything-in-its-path-257885">this unprecedented algal bloom</a> that caused people to get sick and killed wildlife along 100s kilometres of coastline. Scientists still don’t know what triggered it.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-importance-of-feedback-processes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-importance-of-feedback-processes">The importance of feedback processes</h2>
<p>Run-away feedback processes often feature in unanticapted ecological change. The algal bloom initiated a run-away feedback process kind of like a zombie plague. It was killing animals and plant life, the decomposition then created more nutrients that further fueled the bloom.</p>

<p></p></figure><p></p>

<p>Slight changes in these types of feedbacks can result in drastically divergent futures. Representing different plausible feedbacks and different weights for those feedbacks therefore is one way to get at estimating the range of outcomes for the future.</p>
</section>
<section id="qualitative-loop-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qualitative-loop-models">Qualitative loop models</h2>
<p>Loop models are models of feedbacks interconnected systems. They have also been called network models.</p>
<p>Loop models have nodes, which can represent physical or ecological entities such as nutrient concentration, species population size or forest area, and connections, which represent the feedbacks among nodes. Critically, they <em>qualitative</em> predictions of change in the nodes in response to change in other nodes. That is, if one node was to increase will the other nodes increase, stay the same or decrease?</p>
<p>Qualitative models can be <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/12-0207.1?casa_token=nr7e7AeLDawAAAAA%3AAoJqWz-qsoV8ywDuzvVWl_hhbooGJJtHdF0YWTHxNboQnW4yFYQCrjQ7UhppD1Hf5Ts2ICvaRfHdipNa">extended to model the probability of a positive or negative change</a>. They do this by simulating different weights for the feedback loops, across a distribution of plausible weights.</p>
<p>This creates the possibility of exploring how different feedback processes affect the probability of future increases or decreases in an ecosystem.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="application-of-qualitative-models-to-a-high-uncertainty-situation">Application of qualitative models to a high uncertainty situation</h2>
<p>Rising seas and coastal development are pushing mangrove forests beyond their historical limits. Predicting how mangroves will respond is much harder when environmental change is unprecedented. In our study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70468">Projecting Uncertainty in Ecosystem Persistence Under Climate Change</a>, we aimed to estimate the probability that mangrove forests will persist or decline worldwide.</p>
<p>Previous global studies predicting mangrove change have used mechanistic models that make precise quantitative predictions. But I think these models are not honest to the amount of uncertainty we have about mangrove forest dynamics. And the mechanistic models have been criticised for not representing important feedbacks between mangroves and the soils and sediment they grow on.</p>
<p>We used qualitative models to represent feedback processes in mangrove forests.</p>
<p>A mangrove that is healthy traps sediment in its root structures. This sediment helps it rise-up out of the water slowly over time, which is key to persistence if sea levels are rising.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-16-rethinking-ecological-predictions-and-uncertainty/mangrove-feedback-loop.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>But if sediment supplies are cut-off, such as by building a dam upstream, the mangrove can no longer capture sediment to keep up with sea-level-rise. Eventually, the mangrove will be drowned and disappear.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>We mapped the loop models to global data on the distribution of mangroves and their threats to make predictions across the world’s mangroves. Those predictions were made under climate scenario modelling so we could account for multiple climate threats.</p>
<p>Here’s the projections for persistence of mangroves from one of our scenarios:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-16-rethinking-ecological-predictions-and-uncertainty/Buelow_etal2025-graphical-abstract.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We didn’t stop at predicting the future, we also made hindcasts. This let us validate the model against observations, to get an idea of how certain the model was.</p>
<p>For the future predictions, rising seas, storms and reduced sediment from dammed rivers create multiple pressures that led to predicted mangrove loss. In contrast, about 30% of forests were predicted to gain area landward, as they move inland with sea-level rise. However, coastal development often blocks this migration.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, uncertainty is high. In more than half the mangrove units studied, we couldn’t predict whether forests would persist or decline - the probability was essentially random.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="applications-to-management-and-conservation-of-ecosystems">Applications to management and conservation of ecosystems</h2>
<p>Useful predictions don’t have to be accurate. It can be more helpful to know what you don’t know. This means acknowledging the uncertainty in the system you are trying to model.</p>
<p>We tested conservation scenarios and found encouraging results. With targeted management - sediment addition, barrier removal, and assisted migration - the number of units likely to persist could nearly double.</p>
<p>Learning where we don’t know enough to make useful predictions is also useful. This isn’t a model failure. It tells us where better data could tip the balance.</p>
<p>Embracing modelling of feedbacks means embracing uncertainty in ecological futures. Doing so will make our predictions more honest and ultimately more useful for management.</p>

  <title>Should we still teach R coding in this age of genAI?</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-10-should-we-teach-coding/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I often get asked if we should still be teaching coding skills to students and researchers now that we have generative AI tools that can write code for us.</p>
<p>The general consensus is yes, we should still teach coding. For an ecology specific <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14325">argument see here</a>.</p>
<p>Teaching coding is teaching people how to think logically and structure problems. These skills are essential not only in coding, but also for good science and problem solving in general.</p>
<p>So you need to learn to code to learn to think logically and structure problems.</p>
<p>A more practical standpoint is that LLMs are good at generating code that they have seen a lot of examples of in their data. But they are not so good at creative work on novel topics or niche areas.</p>
<p>For example, AI coding assistants struggle to make a simple <code>tmap</code> (the R mapping package) work well. <code>tmap</code> was updated recently, meaning the examples in the LLM’s training are out of date.</p>
<p>The coding assistants also seem to default to code patterns they are most familiar with, like <code>ggplot2</code> syntax. Not all of this works with <code>tmap</code>.</p>
<p>In general, I find they perform much better at statistical modelling in R than they do with complex geospatial analyses.</p>
<p>This practical issue may increasingly become less relevant as LLMs get better and we create better resources to inform their actions (like a tmap specific guide for LLMs to read before advising you, or web searches of the tmap page).</p>
<p>But it is still likely that frontier modelling will require deep human engagement with code. So learning to code is important for researchers.</p>
<p>I’ll leave the final say to Andrej Karpathy, former head of AI at Tesla and founding member of OpenAI’s research group.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy">recent podcast interview</a> he talks about a repo he made to help teach people how to work with LLMs. His advice to learners is literally to re-write his repo by hand, not even to cut and paste.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain that AI agents are good for very standard code or code that is common on the internet. But they perform poorly for creating new code, or code that contradicts common patterns.</p>
<p>For any research code he most commonly uses the code auto-complete features that AI assistants have, rather than AI agents.</p>
<p>He suggests that to really learn something you should code it yourself, using examples only as references.</p>
<p>Karpathy came up with the term ‘vibe-coding’ which means creating code by prompting, without reviewing the code. Usually an AI agent is used. So its saying a lot if he thinks that learning means doing it the old fashioned way of writing code yourself.</p>

  <title>How AI coding assistants can bias your coding and analysis</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-09-biasing-when-using-AI-coding-assistants/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m a frequent user of AI coding assistants to speed up my coding. I’m mostly using Github Copilot and the Roo Code agentic extension for VSCode, with various large language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>We hear a lot about biases and LLMs, which got me wondering, what biases might the use of coding assistants induce in my coding and data analysis?</p>
<p>Biases are a concern in other areas of applications of LLMs to the workplace. For instance, LLMs are known to be sexist, biased towards recommending science articles from certain parts of the world and even biased towards <a href="https://futurism.com/grok-looks-up-what-elon-musk-thinks">Elon Musk’s opinions</a>.</p>
<p>I had thought that using LLMs mainly to assist with R code would mean that I’m reasonably immune to issues with biases in LLMs.</p>
<p>But after a recent experience in Python I realized there are subtle types of biases in LLMs that could have a big impact on the quality of an analysis.</p>
<p>I had considered that LLMs might recommend certain types of statistical tests more frequently than others, perhaps biasing me to the dominant statistical methodologies (like they seem to more commonly recommend frequentist over Bayesian generalized linear models).</p>
<p>But I wasn’t concerned about that. I have a pretty broad view of stats in my field, and I usually don’t use LLMs for recommending new methods. I look to the scientific literature for that advice.</p>
<p>LLMs might have their own particular ways of implementing code, but the end result of a given statistical test, is the same, it doesn’t matter much how you get there.</p>
<p>Using Python changed my view on this. I’m a lifelong R coder, not a Python coder. However, I wanted to learn some deep learning analyses, for which I needed Python. So I set about using my coding assistant to write me a tutorial on learn deep learning in Python.</p>
<p>The way LLM coding assistants can bias your code is that most are set-up to be sycophantic. So they amplify your own biases by affirming that whatever you have is good.</p>
<p>This became apparent when me, the R coder, was bringing my R informed ideas for writing code to Python. The LLM led me down paths for implementing code that make sense in R land, but which are not best practice for implementation in Python.</p>
<p>I realized this once I started referring to real Python tutorials.</p>
<p>More generally, LLMs tend to be affirmative of your requests. For a data analysis workflow this means they will tend to amplify whatever biases you start out with.</p>
<p>Errors that cause code to fail are ok, because they are easy to detect. What is more concerning is if the LLM amplify subtle mistakes in choice of statistics.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9493/">pre-print on using LLMs and AI coding assistants for ecological data analysis</a>. One of our recommendations is to split your workflow into parts.</p>
<p>In particular, it helps to choose the analysis before you plan how the code will be written (and what software or packages you will use). If you conflate these two different decisions you are more likely to make mistakes that are amplified. Best to choose your analysis using AI but also by reading the literature. Then get the AI to help you implement that.</p>
<p>The other problem is that you finish your analysis and the LLM has led you to think it is excellent. You submit that analysis for peer-review and the reviewers think differently.</p>
<p>So its a good idea to check your work against the discipline norms, and ideally get expert colleagues to take a look too. Take everything an LLM says with a grain of salt, especially if it agrees with you.</p>

  <title>Giant kelp restoration could boost fisheries productivity in Tasmania</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-08-kelp-restoration-fisheries/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Kelp restoration is gaining <a href="https://kelpforestalliance.com/">global momentum</a> with recognition that we are losing kelp forests and the values they provide as habitat for biodiversity and supporting fisheries.</p>
<p>But questions remain. We wanted to know if restoring giant kelp forests boost productivity for commercially important species like abalone and rock lobster. We <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.70242">explore this question in our new study</a>. (Free access version <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/12/20/2024.12.16.628810.full.pdf">here</a> or <a href="mailto:c.j.brown@utas.edu.au">email me</a> for a copy)</p>
<p>We took measurements of kelp growth from Tasmania’s East Coast and used them in models of ecosystems to study how gain kelp restoration could impact fisheries.</p>
<p>We found the productivity gains could be substantial.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-08-kelp-restoration-fisheries/kelp-productvity-foodwebs.jpg" class="img-fluid"> <strong>Figure</strong> Key findings</p>
<section id="why-giant-kelp-matters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-giant-kelp-matters">Why giant kelp matters</h2>
<p>Giant kelp <em>Macrocystis pyrifera</em> has largely disappeared from Tasmania’s east coast, replaced by the less productive <em>Ecklonia radiata</em>. The productivity difference between these two species is striking - giant kelp is approximately 40 times more productive than Ecklonia.</p>
<p>That extra productivity has to go somewhere. While we still need more research to fully understand the fate of giant kelp biomass, the evidence suggests it flows through the food web to support a wide range of species, including those important for fisheries.</p>
</section>
<section id="modelling-food-web-effects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modelling-food-web-effects">Modelling food web effects</h2>
<p>We used ecosystem models to trace how increased macroalgae productivity from giant kelp restoration moves through the food web. The model shows productivity flowing from the restored kelp to herbivores like abalone, then up through different predator-prey interactions to boost productivity across many species in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The most confident results come from the productivity measurements themselves - based on extensive, long-term datasets comparing giant kelp and Ecklonia across different areas and seasons.</p>
<p>Then we use those data in the model to predict the effects of meeting Australia’s restoration targets for giant kelp (restore 30% of degraded habitats).</p>
<p>The model predicted improvements of fishery catch of 1-7%, depending on the species. This is a substantial improvement given the scale of the model is the entirety of Tasmania and the area of kelp restoration is relatively small compared to that total area.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-08-kelp-restoration-fisheries/2023-11-13_kelp-forest.jpg" class="img-fluid"> <strong>Figure</strong> Giant kelp breaking up in later summer - its death and decomposition provides food to microbes that feeds energy into the local foodweb.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-the-models-dont-capture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-the-models-dont-capture">What the models don’t capture</h2>
<p>Our model looked across all of Tasmania’s waters. Future improvements could study local changes in fishery productivity near to kelp forests. These are likely to be more substantial and could benefit fishers the most in those areas.</p>
<p>The models focused on overall ecosystem productivity gains, but giant kelp provides additional benefits not captured in these predictions. Restoring dense surface canopies creates more habitat and refuge for juvenile fish, which could lead to even higher increases in fish productivity than the models predict.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-global-goals-to-local-action" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-global-goals-to-local-action">From global goals to local action</h2>
<p>Our study demonstrates how global restoration targets can be translated into specific, outcome-based goals relevant to local communities. In Tasmania, the positive impacts of giant kelp restoration on kelp forest health and fisheries productivity align well with local values and needs.</p>
<p>Models are particularly valuable at this stage of kelp restoration because we’re still in the early phases of upscaling. In the absence of previous large-scale examples to learn from, models help set realistic expectations and make the case for restoration investments. Models like this help show how restoration has relevance to communities. Community groups are more likely to support restoration when expected outcomes are clear and relevant to their specific needs.</p>
<p>Giant kelp is worth restoring not just because it’s something we’ve lost, but because of the ecosystem-wide benefits it provides.</p>

  <title>New report looks at how we allocate monitoring of fishing activities</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-02-how-to-allocate-fisheries-monitoring/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>How do we monitor fisheries to know if seafood is sustainable? It turns out WHERE we monitor is just as important as HOW MUCH we monitor. The “where” needs to be codified in fisheries policies if we want a reliable picture of what is caught.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/t/n/TNC-Utas-2025-estimatingCatch.pdf">In this new report with The Nature Conservancy</a> we explore the implications of different ways of monitoring a fishery, especially with modern electronic monitoring (video) tech. The problem is that current policies might say “Monitor 30% of fishing activity”, but they are not specific about how that 30% is allocated.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-02-how-to-allocate-fisheries-monitoring/Figure1conceptual.jpg" class="img-fluid"> <strong>Figure</strong> Different monitoring protocols, we recommend monitoring all vessels and then sub-sampling your 30% randomly, to get an unbiased estimate of catch and bycatch.</p>
<p>The most reliable data is provided when you have cameras on every vessel, then sample those videos at random. But ‘monitor 30%’ could also be interpreted as 30% of vessels or 30% of fishing trips. The 30% you see might be the best 30% and you miss high bycatch of threatened species in the other 70%, for instance.</p>

<p>It was great to work with Vienna Saccomanno and Ben Gilmer from TNC on this question, which comes down to using ecological statistics to solve a real policy issue.</p>

  <title>AI has raised the bar for literature reviews</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-12-01-ai-raises-bar-literature-reviews/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been reviewing papers recently that provide lists of applications - particularly common in reviews about AI use in ecology and fisheries. But lists of topics don’t provide a compelling read.</p>
<p>More importantly, any chatbot can generate a well researched list now. ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot all have web search integrated. <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/10-research-applications-LLMs.html#sec-websearch">Perplexity AI</a> can generate detailed accurately referenced 10,000 word reports that are essentially lists on everything about a topic. Try asking “how can AI be used in ecology with references?” and you’ll get a comprehensive list in seconds.</p>
<p>If readers can generate that content themselves with AI, why would they bother reading your journal article? And if you’re producing content that AI can replicate, why does science need your career?</p>
<p>Generative AI raises the standard for what needs to go into literature reviews. Reviews need to be informed by deep human thought. AI can be a tool to help develop a review, but you need original insights that go beyond what everyday chatbots can produce.</p>
<p>One example that gets this right is <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.70120">a recent paper reviewing multimodal large language models in Methods in Ecology and Evolution</a>. They do list different applications of the technology, but there’s greater depth in the examples than what you could get out of an AI. They provide ecology-specific examples that take work to develop and find. More importantly, they synthesize these potential uses and discuss future challenges and directions with tangible actions.</p>
<p>Going forward, AI has raised the bar for literature reviews. Don’t write or produce anything that AI can easily generate. There’s no point - anyone can grab that content themselves and you are making yourself redundant. Reviews need to bring deep domain expertise, synthesis, and original thought.</p>

  <title>Tips on making science infographics with AI and nano banana</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-28-tips-making-infographics-with-ai/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-23-exploring-gemini-3-image-generation/">Google Gemini Pro 3 (AKA Nano Banana)</a> as a way to make science infographics. Here are the key lessons from my attempts.</p>
<p>I’m accessing the model via API calls with Python, example code is at the end. However, you could also do this via the chat interface.</p>
<p>For the record I’d still prefer to work with a human to create great infographics. A good designed will give you much more than just create the image, they will help you think through the key points and how most accurately to represent those. You’ll see below that I had some issues with scientific accuracy of the AI generated images. But I don’t have the budget for a designer on every project. AI images are good if you are clear on the key points you want to communicate.</p>

<section id="see-what-the-ai-comes-up-with" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="see-what-the-ai-comes-up-with">See what the AI comes up with</h2>
<p>Just point the AI to your study using a web search. It is pretty good at simultaneously interpreting the key points from the abstract and then generated an image to go along with that. Here’s my first attempt:</p>
<pre><code>Create a two panel infographic in cartoon style showing fisheries species that benefit from giant kelp restoration. In the left panel show small Ecklonia plants. In the right panel show giant kelp. Base the infographic on the recent study 'Predicting the impact of giant kelp restoration on food webs and fisheries production'. Include the 40x productivity boost. But don't include the numbers for the fishery species, just show which ones go up. Use bright colors and clear labels.</code></pre>

<p>With the web search feature enabled the model can find the article via the title I provided in the prompt.</p>
<p>This looks pretty nice for a very simple prompt and the ‘40x’ stat is accurate to the paper.</p>
<p>However on closer inspection there are a few issues.</p>
<p>The fish look North American, our study was in Tasmania. The abalone are upside down.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is that the image implies there was a 40X boost in productivity to fisheries, which is not what we found. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.70242">We found a 40x boost in kelp productivity that translated into 1-7% boost for fisheries</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="name-a-style" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="name-a-style">Name a style</h2>
<p>Its fun to play around with different styles. For the infographics below I tried ‘water colour style’ and ‘line-art botantical style’. You can get ideas for styles from lists on the web or a chatbot.</p>
<p>I don’t want the images to be too much like photos, I want it to be obvious that they are not ‘real’.</p>
<p>Some ideas for styles to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cartoon (AI will choose its own style)</li>
<li>Watercolour</li>
<li>Botanical line-art</li>
<li>Like ‘The Simpsons’ or your favourite cartoon. Just add “Don’t include any proprietary characters in the image” to avoid it using images that might violate copyright.</li>
<li>Gothic</li>
<li>Pencil sketch</li>
<li>Manga</li>
</ul>
<p>Or anything that is common enough the AI will know it.</p>
</section>
<section id="include-reference-images" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="include-reference-images">Include reference images</h2>
<p>Next attempt I tried a water colour style and I attached reference images of Tasmanian reef fauna to the prompt:</p>
<pre><code>Create a two panel infographic in water colour style showing fisheries species that benefit from giant kelp restoration. In the left panel show a rocky reef with dense but small Ecklonia plants. In the right panel show a rocky reef with a healthy giant kelp forest. Include on the right panel the text: 40x kelp productivity boost. Include the animals in the reference images, showing more of them in the right panel. Redraw the animals to match the water colour style and so they look a natural part of the scene, but keep their essential morphological features intact. </code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-28-tips-making-infographics-with-ai/reef-scene2 Large.jpeg" style="max-height: 600px; width: auto;"></p>
<p>This looks more like a Tasmanian reef and is clearer that the 40x applies to kelp. But unfortunately the abalone are still upside down - I accidentally included an image of the abalone foot in my reference list.</p>
<p>The image also lacks context, so I wanted to try add some text in the watercolour style:</p>
<pre><code>Update this infographic to add a sub-panel to the left hand panel that reads: 'Giant kelp forests have disappeared in many places, but are more productive than other algae. O'Neill et al. used models to predict how giant kelp restoration can enhance fisheries'. Adjust the composition so all text is clearly readable and the images are arranged in a balanced, visually appealing layout.</code></pre>
<p>I also corrected the reference image for abalone to only show the shell.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-28-tips-making-infographics-with-ai/reef-scene2d-gem3 Large.jpeg" style="max-height: 600px; width: auto;"></p>
<p>The coauthors and I were happy with this versio. I then just used powerpoint to add the DOI to the study as well as a statement: “Image: AI generated, human verified”.</p>
<p>I think people like to know what is generated by AI, but I wanted my audience to know that I had checked it for factual accuracy.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-more-text-the-more-likely-there-are-to-be-errors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-more-text-the-more-likely-there-are-to-be-errors">The more text the more likely there are to be errors</h2>
<p>I had one more attempt with <a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/rec.70261">a study about mangrove restoration</a>.</p>
<p>For this one I had the prompt:</p>
<pre><code>Create an infographic in line-art botantical style explaining the following study for a general audience: ...</code></pre>
<p>Then I included the entire abstract in the prompt.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-28-tips-making-infographics-with-ai/jordan-study-gem3 Large.jpeg" style="max-height: 600px; width: auto;"></p>
<p>If you look closely you will notice lots of errors in the text.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompting-with-the-study-abstract-didnt-work-as-well">Prompting with the study abstract didn’t work as well</h2>
<p>The infographic based on the abstract was also too detailed for what I wanted. It would be better to go back to tip 1 (be clear on study outcomes) and just provide the AI with 1-3 key points to represent.</p>
</section>
<section id="leave-space-for-post-production-modifications" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="leave-space-for-post-production-modifications">Leave space for post-production modifications</h2>
<p>I’d like to be able to modify these easily by adding text boxes in powerpoint (I’m not sophisticated with image editing!).</p>
<p>My final tip is to ask the AI to leave a ‘white box’ in a certain position, that way you can add text to it later, making sure it is accurate.</p>

  <title>Reasoning and infographics with Nano Banana</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-23-exploring-gemini-3-image-generation/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The new Google Gemini Pro 3 (AKA Nano Banana) has some <a href="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/">pretty impressive image generation capabilities</a>. It is very accurate to what you ask in the prompt, it can ‘ground’ image generation with web searches and it accurately renders text (most of the time). This increases its usefulness for scientific visualisation purposes over previous models.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3?thinking=high">how to use it here</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to try it out for scientific applications.</p>
<section id="science-cartoon-with-web-search-grounding" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="science-cartoon-with-web-search-grounding">Science cartoon with web search grounding</h2>
<p>I ran this prompt for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.70242">a very recent study</a> that was only just published, so well beyond the cut-off data for inclusion in the model’s training data:</p>
<pre><code>Make a comic strip explaining key findings of the study: 'Predicting the impact of giant kelp restoration on food webs and fisheries production'. Use a cartoon style similar to spongebob squarepants, but dont use any spongebob characters that violate copyright. Instead make the characters a fish, a rock lobster and an abalone.</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-23-exploring-gemini-3-image-generation/study-cartoon2.jpeg" style="max-height: 600px; width: auto;"></p>
<p>This study was published after the model’s cutoff data for inclusion of training data, so it is a useful test of the search grounding capabilities. It gets the details right, though urchin barrens aren’t the main cause of the giant kelp decline and kelp normally grows on rocks, not sand.</p>
<p>My original attempt didn’t include the statement about copyright and it made an image that included Spongebob and his friends - some work for Google to do here if they are going to avoid copyright violations.</p>
<pre><code>Make a comic strip explaining key findings of the study: 'Predicting the impact of giant kelp restoration on food webs and fisheries production'. Use a cartoon style similar to spongebob squarepants.</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="infographics-with-grounding" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="infographics-with-grounding">Infographics with grounding</h2>
<p>I ran this prompt that asks for an infographic for <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.70105">my recent study</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Make an infographic explaining the new research study 'Assessing predictive accuracy of species abundance models in dynamic systems' published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution </code></pre>
<p>Here’s the result</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-23-exploring-gemini-3-image-generation/study-infographic.jpeg" style="max-height: 600px; width: auto;"></p>
<p>Which is 100% accurate. The only thing I’d change would be to add the study’s DOI to the infographic.</p>
</section>
<section id="r-code" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-code">R code</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of visual reasoning. Here we ask the model to generate an image of R code with resulting plot:</p>
<pre><code>Generate an image of R code and a graph in an IDE. The code will show how to fit a linear regression to data. The graph will show temperature on the x-axis and # people of the y-axis. Title the graph Swimming in Tasmania</code></pre>
<p>The results show the model is capable of correctly interpreting the R code it wrote:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-23-exploring-gemini-3-image-generation/rcode.jpg" style="max-height: 600px; width: auto;"></p>
<p>This is not a screen shot of an IDE (note the errors in the names of panels) but an image generated to represent a screenshot.</p>
</section>
<section id="visual-reasoning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visual-reasoning">Visual reasoning</h2>
<p>To further test the visual reasoning I set a more complex task of plotting some data that I specified, showing a GAM fit to that data and plotting the residuals.</p>
<pre><code>Generate a two panel plot created with the R program. Here is the data to use for the plots: `x &lt;- 1:10; y &lt;- c(5, 10, 11, 9, 15, 12, 13, 6, 3, 2)`. The first panel will show an x-y plot of the data, as well as a the fitted curve from a gam spline with 3 dimension basis function. The second panel will show the residuals of the model with a horizontal line at y=0. Show the plots as a single image with two panels side by side.</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-23-exploring-gemini-3-image-generation/rcode-gam.jpeg" style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"></p>
<p>This one got the data points approximately correct (blue points), but was off with the GAM fit and residuals. For example, according to its fitted curve (red) the first, second and third residuals (green points) should be at zero. Likewise the two final points should be at zero. For comparison, here’s the answer if I generate that with actual R code:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-23-exploring-gemini-3-image-generation/gam_plot.jpg" style="max-height: 400px; width: auto;"></p>
<p>You can see the AI generated residual plot was well off the mark, both in terms of the residuals</p>
</section>
<section id="code-for-api-access" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-for-api-access">Code for API access</h2>
<p>At the moment the easiest way to use this model is via the Gemini chat platform, or via direct API calls.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the Python code to use the Gemini API.</p>
<pre><code>from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")

# The client gets the API key from the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
client = genai.Client(api_key=api_key)

prompt = "Generate a two panel plot created with the R program. Here is the data to use for the plots: `x &lt;- 1:10; y &lt;- c(5, 10, 11, 9, 15, 12, 13, 6, 3, 2)`. The first panel will show an x-y plot of the data, as well as a the fitted curve from a gam spline with 3 dimension basis function. The second panel will show the residuals of the model with a horizontal line at y=0. Show the plots as a single image with two panels side by side. "
aspect_ratio = "3:4" # "1:1","2:3","3:2","3:4","4:3","4:5","5:4","9:16","16:9","21:9"

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
    contents=prompt,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_modalities=['Text', 'Image'],
        image_config=types.ImageConfig(
            aspect_ratio=aspect_ratio,
        )#,
        #tools=[{"google_search": {}}]
    )
)

for part in response.parts:
    if part.text is not None:
        print(part.text)
    elif image:= part.as_image():
        image.save("temp/rcode.png")</code></pre>
<p>I’ve commented out the web search grounding. Uncomment that if you want to ground your search.</p>

  <title>When a species’ fate hangs on survey design</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-21-survey-design-endangered-species/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Survey design can be one of those dry academic topics that students shy away from. So I wanted to highlight the sad case of the Greater Glider, a gliding possum.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-logging-rules-in-nsw-put-the-greater-glider-closer-to-extinction-when-will-we-start-protecting-these-amazing-animals-223182">greater glider is on its way to extinction</a> thanks in part due to insufficient survey designs.</p>
<p>As a protected species there are buffer zones for logging around <em>known</em> greater glider habitat. The buffers are bigger still if a glider den (tree hollow) is confirmed. The “known” part is where survey design comes in.</p>
<p>The problem is, current survey designs are <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-21/environment-groups-decry-greater-glider-survey-results/106017274">not sufficient to reliably detect greater gliders</a>.</p>
<p>Gliders emerge from their dens around sunset then go out to forage.</p>
<p>Official surveys are limited to roads and to a short period around sunset. But this means they will miss glider dens that aren’t near roads. That’s also a very limited amount of time to spot a cryptic species.</p>
<p>The quality of the official survey design is indicated by the fact that citizen scientists found 918 gliders in an area where the official survey only found 42.</p>
<p>From a statistical viewpoint the official survey design potentially suffers from two issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bias, in that only habitats near roads are surveyed</li>
<li>Low detection rates, in that the time surveyed is too limited.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below I want to illustrate the detectability aspect, as its obvious how you deal with the bias aspect (do more complete surveys of the area).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-21-survey-design-endangered-species/possum.jpg" class="img-fluid"> Brushtail possum considering its detectability model (AI generated image).</p>
<section id="detectability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="detectability">Detectability</h2>
<p>In ecology we use repeat surveys to estimate a species’ detectability.</p>
<p>Detectability is a key parameter to estimate and then to account for when designing surveys.</p>
<p>Let me show you with a simple simulation how repeat surveys dramatically improve your chances of detecting a species that’s actually present.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div>
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-21-survey-design-endangered-species/index_files/figure-html/detection-simulation-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The simulation shows a dramatic improvement in detection probability with repeat surveys.</p>
<p>Estimating the detectability parameter can be complicated with real world survey designs. But the good news is that it is a well researched area of ecology and many frameworks (with handy R packages) exist to help you. Using these methods is a must for cryptic species.</p>
</section>
<section id="survey-design-matters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="survey-design-matters">Survey design matters</h2>
<p>Issues of survey design often come up in environmental controversies. Its an important area for conservation biologists to study and to learn well. They need to know the principles so they can make a strong case for survey designs that are sufficient to protect endangered species.</p>
<p>Let’s hope that the survey design for gliders can be turned around, as conservationists are advocating for, so we can save this unique Australian mammal.</p>

  <title>Should I post my manuscript to a pre-print server?</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-15-should-i-do-a-pre-print/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In our recent lab meeting we <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2018-08-20-biorxiv-pre-print-posting-guide/index.html">revisited the topic of pre-prints and pre-print servers</a> to answer the question - should I post a pre-print of my manuscript?</p>
<p>Thanks to Jordan Holdorf for helping me write this post and Matt Holden for contributions via linkedin.</p>
<p>In a recent lab meeting, we revisited the question: Should I post a preprint of my manuscript? A few years ago, <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2018-08-20-biorxiv-pre-print-posting-guide/index.html">I wrote about this topic after posting my fourth preprint to bioRxiv</a>. Since then, the landscape has shifted, and our discussion—thanks to Jordan Holdorf for the notes—highlighted new considerations worth sharing.</p>

<section id="what-are-preprints" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-preprints">What Are Preprints?</h2>
<p>Preprints are manuscripts shared publicly before formal peer review. They’re free to post, free to read, and usually come with a DOI, making them citable. Popular servers include arXiv, bioRxiv, EcoEvoRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN.</p>
<p>The concept isn’t new, arXiv launched in physics back in 1991, but preprints surged during COVID-19 as scientists raced to share findings quickly. Conservation science and ecology have increasingly embraced preprints as well.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-bother-pros-and-cons">Why Bother? Pros and Cons</h2>
<section id="pros" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visibility and speed: Your work is accessible immediately, not months later.</li>
<li>Feedback: Pre-review comments can strengthen your paper.</li>
<li>Citations: Preprints can be cited, even if the journal version is paywalled.</li>
<li>Priority: Posting establishes your claim to an idea.</li>
<li>Flexibility: You can build on work that’s still under review.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cons" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quality concerns: Preprints aren’t peer-reviewed, so errors can spread.</li>
<li>Misinformation risk: Especially if high-profile topics get picked up by the press.</li>
<li>Version confusion: If titles change, citations may split across versions.</li>
<li>Journal policies: Most journals now allow preprints, but check first.</li>
<li>Double-blind issues: Reviewers can find your preprint and identify authors.</li>
<li>Time cost: Uploading and revising adds extra steps.</li>
<li>Google Scholar may not list your published article for up to 6 months after publication (rather than the normal few days delay after publishing). This is a known issue with pre-prints on SSRN and bioRxiv, apparently fixed for arxiv pre-prints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the benefits usually outweigh the drawbacks—if you manage the process carefully.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="key-considerations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-considerations">Key considerations</h2>
<p>Some lab members expressed concern that their work could get stolen from a pre-print and published by an other author. I would think this is rare, however, with AI making it increasingly easy to paraphrase other people’s work, the risk is probably higher than it used to be.</p>
<p>We decided that if you are concerned about plagiarism, it is best not to link your open code repository in the preprint. That could make it too easy for a bad actor to create a new version of your work.</p>
<p>Media is another factor. Journalists generally prefer to cover peer-reviewed work, though during COVID, preprints made headlines. For most fields, you can expect little media attention until formal publication. This is good, as peer review is crucial for credibility.</p>
<p>Finally, think strategically. Preprints make sense for urgent topics, methods papers, or when you want community feedback. They’re less practical if you’re under time pressure or working on a niche topic.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-post-a-preprint" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-post-a-preprint">How to Post a Preprint</h2>
<p>Here’s a streamlined guide based on experience and Jordan’s notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish the manuscript and get coauthor approval. Check your target journal’s preprint policy.</li>
<li>Format carefully. Upload a polished PDF with clear figures, tables, and your contact info.</li>
<li>Sign up for a server and ORCID. ORCID helps link your work across platforms.</li>
<li>Choose a license. Think about reuse—Creative Commons options vary.</li>
<li>Upload and wait. Most servers take ~24 hours to post.</li>
<li>Share strategically. Share on social media (to other scientists, not for general public), email colleagues, or post on Google Scholar if you want feedback.</li>
<li>Revise before acceptance. Once your paper is accepted, most servers block updates. Link the final version. Matching titles help merge citations; otherwise, see the server’s instructions for how to fix the connection.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="my-experience" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>I’ve had mixed results. One preprint was redundant because the journal review was lightning-fast. Another has been cited multiple times while stuck in review purgatory—proof that preprints can keep your work alive. The biggest headache? Title changes. If your published title differs, make sure the preprint links correctly.</p>

<p>Preprints aren’t a magic bullet, but they’re a powerful tool when used thoughtfully. They accelerate science, increase visibility, and invite collaboration—but they also demand care around version control, anonymity, and journal policies.</p>
<p>On the balance of it I use them selectively. For work that is time-sensitive, methodologically important, or where I want feedback, then I do a pre-print. If I’m busy or there is little to gain, then I skip it.</p>

<p>R workshops in Brisbane Australia, February 2026.</p>
<p>For many years I had the pleasure of teaching with Ant Richardson and the team for these R workshops. I’m not there anymore, but recommend attending these if you can make the dates:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-14-upcoming-R-workshop-brisbane/r-workshop-uq.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Transform your research questions into robust statistical insights with our 2026 Summer R Workshops in an immersive exploration of R programming and statistical modelling. These workshops in February 2026 are designed for beginners and researchers who want to build a solid foundation in R programming and progress through to advanced statistical techniques. Whether you’re completely new to R or looking to strengthen your statistical modelling skills, join us to develop the analytical expertise essential for modern research!</p>
<p>Registration is now open. For more information, see our website https://mathmarecol.github.io/RWorkshop/summer.html and the attached flyer. For any questions, email cbcs-workshops@uq.edu.au.</p>
<p>Testimonials: “I truly enjoyed the whole workshop. Great teachers, really nice real data examples and good notes and background” “I am feeling a lot better about using stats now than I was previously” “I think it should be a compulsory course for all PhDs”</p>

  <title>Its easy to make your own AI agent in R</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-11-10-make-an-ai-agent-in-r/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There’s a lot of hype about AI agents, but buried under the hype there is a really simple architecture. I got inspired by <a href="https://fly.io/blog/everyone-write-an-agent/">this post that points out how easy it is to make an AI agent</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll show how to make an agent in R with the <a href="https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/"><code>ellmer</code> package</a>.</p>
<p>A large language model agent is a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/">large language models that can run tools in a loop</a>.</p>
<p>Tools give the agent powers to take actions like read data, create files, access the internet. Anything software task you can think of really.</p>
<p>Here’s the cool thing, the ‘run tools in a loop’ architecture is simple. Building an AI (the LLM) is really complex and super expensive (like cost of $100 millions). But you can easily get access to 100s of these LLMs cheaply via API calls. Then its easy to plug them into DIY agents.</p>
<p>The simplicity means you can create just about anything you can dream up.</p>
<p>Let’s make an agent that reads R help files. A chat agent could give better advice if it read the up-to-date R help files first.</p>
<section id="chatting-with-llms-from-rs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chatting-with-llms-from-rs">Chatting with LLMs from Rs</h2>

<p>Set up an <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/03-set-up.html#sec-apikeys">API key with the provider</a> you choose and you can easily talk to a large language model with ellmer:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1">chat <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;

<p>We can then string together a chat:</p>

<p>The way a multi-turn conversation works is that on the second turn the entire conversation thread (system message, user message, assistant message, new user message) is sent back to the LLM at each turn.</p>
<p>Repeated calls to <code>chat</code> just manage that for us.</p>
<p>The LLM talking to itself isn’t very useful, we can use tools to inject new information into the conversation.</p>

<p>LLMs often get tripped up if you ask them for code for niche or very recent packages. The <a href="https://zobaer09.github.io/FakeDataR/"><code>FakeDataR</code> package</a> is a recently released package that helps you make synthetic data to use with LLMs (if you are concerned about privacy of your real data).</p>
<p>If you ask an LLM to use this package, it will tend to hallucinate a response, that won’t work. With our tool however, it can create accurate code:</p>

<pre><code>I'll help you find information about the `generate_fake_data` function from the
FakeDataR package.

◯ [tool call] read_help_as_text(pkg = "FakeDataR", topic =
"generate_fake_data")
...

Great! Now I can show you how to use `generate_fake_data` to create a synthetic
copy of the `mtcars` dataset. Here's how to do it:

## Basic Usage

```r
# Install FakeDataR if you haven't already
# install.packages("FakeDataR")

library(FakeDataR)

# Generate synthetic data from mtcars
synthetic_mtcars &lt;- generate_fake_data(
  data = mtcars,
  n = 32  # Create same number of rows as original mtcars
)

# View the result
head(synthetic_mtcars)
```

## More Detailed Examples
...
The resulting synthetic dataset preserves the structure and statistical 
properties of the original while being completely artificial!</code></pre>

<p>The write R code tool worked, some of the time… Other times it wrote a blank file. There’s a lot of niggly details to making agents work reliably, including choosing a powerful enough LLM, writing a system prompt that guides tool use, and writing powerful but secure tools.</p>
<p>If I was going to take this example further I could add a function to run the Rscript that was created, that might require some extra security considerations (see below for one example).</p>
<p>Going further I would also work on system prompt that provided guidance to the LLM on its role and how to approach problems. There’s many open source system prompts out there that I could draw on to create this.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Its an exciting time to be working on AI agents. The field is so new you can easily make new discoveries and be ahead of even world leading AI labs.</p>
<p>An example. Scott Spillias, a postdoc at CSIRO, developed an agent framework that uses an evolutionary algorithm to write math to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.14.664628v1.abstract">create ecosystem models</a>. He showed the agent could create models that are great at predicting out-of-sample data, and that have biologically meaningful parameters.</p>
<p>A month or so after he published his pre-print, the Google DeepMind team published a similar idea of using LLM evolutionary algorithms to generate scientific models.</p>
<p>I look forwards to seeing what the R community creates with agents.</p>

  <title>Estimating harvest levels to reduce feral deer populations in Tasmania</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-23-deer-harvest-reduction/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Feral deer were introduced to Tasmania for hunting, but are becoming an increasing environmental, agricultural and road safety issue. They damage sensitive vegetation and even <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-10/seymour-wetland-tas-project-battles-deer/105156466">disrupt attempts to restore coastal wetlands</a>. A <a href="https://nre.tas.gov.au/Documents/The%202024%20aerial%20survey%20of%20fallow%20deer%20in%20Tasmania%20-%20summary%20report.pdf">recent report</a> shows results from a new survey indicating that the deer population is booming.</p>
<p>(Here’s a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-02/tas-new-feral-deer-survey-shows-population-boom/105843366">news article summarizing the report</a>).</p>
<p>I’m interested in the question how much harvesting is required to reduce deer populations. As a fisheries scientists, I’m usually asking the reverse question, of how much harvesting is too much. In this case, we want to overharest to reduce populations.</p>
<p>One suggestion from recreational hunting groups is to allow more hunting to control deer populations. But how much hunting would have to happen and is it feasible for recreational hunters to take that much?</p>
<p>The management problem is that deer in Tasmania are managed in zones, including sustainable hunting zones and no-go zones. The no-go zones are there to protect sennsitive enviroments, whereas the hunting zones are there to manage deer populations to allow ongoing recreational hunting.</p>
<p>But deer don’t obey jurisdictional boundaries and the new survey clearly shows the deer population is spreading. There are similar issues <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-17/sa-deer-eradication-program-aerial-culling-reduces-population/105763068">on the mainland with different states having different management approaches</a>.</p>
<p>This problem is an interesting exercise in population modelling, and I cover the details below. But there are also scientific studies on the harvest rates required to stabilize deer populations. A study done in Tasmania estimated a rate of <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.14546">25% of the population per year would be needed just to stabilise populations</a>.</p>
<p>Given the estimate of 71,655 deer in 2024, that would equate to about 17,900 deer needing to be harvested each year just to stabilise the population. We’d need to harvest significantly more than that to reduce the population.</p>
<p>I did some research but unfortunately couldn’t find any data on how many deer recreational hunters hunt or how many hunting licenses there are in Tasmania. But we can make some educated guesses. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/emr.70001">This study</a> found that 28 hunters killed 128 deer over 3 years on one private reserve in Tasmania.</p>
<p>That amounts to about 1.5 deer per hunter per year. Thus, to harvest 17,900 deer per year would require about 11,933 hunters. That of course assumes the same success and participation rate. To get a substantial population decrease we’d need a much higher harvest rate, perhaps double that number of deer, meaning over 20,000 hunters would be needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/emr.70001">This study sums it up nicely</a>:</p>
<p>” Wild deer populations in Australia and New Zealand <strong>are increasing and require active management</strong> to reduce their impacts on agriculture, natural values and human safety. It is sometimes suggested that recreational hunting, a popular activity in both countries, could be an effective tool for managing wild deer populations, but its effectiveness has seldom been demonstrated (Bengsen and Sparkes 2016). <strong>Our study showed that recreational hunting of fallow deer on a private reserve in Tasmania sustained a population density of 4–5 deer per km 2, higher than the average deer density in Tasmania</strong>. To effectively act as a control tool to reduce deer density, as proposed in the Tasmanian Wild Fallow Deer Management Plan 2022–27, recreational hunters would need to increase the number of deer killed annually well above 35% of the population, while targeting females primarily. <strong>This could be achieved by removing the ‘Partly Protected Wildlife’ status of fallow deer in Tasmania</strong> and its consequent restrictions on hunting seasons, quotas and shooting equipment (The Tasmanian Government 2023). Landholders can apply for special purposes wildlife property protection or crop protection permits to control deer on their properties, but completely removing that restriction, as was done in NSW (Bengsen and Forsyth 2019), would facilitate deer management on private land and most likely increase the annual deer harvest ”</p>
<p>Source: https://doi.org/10.1111/emr.70001</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Tasmania has that many active deer hunters that could be enabled by further removing restrictions. But more data on hunting participation is required to confirm or deny that claim.</p>
<p>Other approaches such as professional culling and eradication by landholders will likely be required to achieve meaningful population reductions.</p>
<section id="population-growth-calculations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="population-growth-calculations">Population growth calculations</h2>
<p>We can do our own simple calculations to estimate the harvest rate required to reduce deer populations. Note I provide below as an educational example only. I recommend using the studies cited above for real advice on rates (as you’ll see I get quite different numbers).</p>
<p>Tasmania’s deer population has grown from about 53,660 to 71,655 individuals over 5 years (note there is errors around those numbers that we won’t consider here).</p>
<p>Population growth is rarely linear. For the deer a reasonable approximation would be that deer are increasingly exponentially, meaning non-linearly at an increasing numbers of new animals each year. I make this assertion based the fact that their distribution is also growing, suggesting a growing population that is currently unhindered by environmental limits (e.g.&nbsp;food).</p>
<p>For growing populations its convenient to work with instantaneous rates of increase (<code>r</code>). <code>r</code> is a the rate of increase on a multiplicative (or ‘log’) scale. Let’s see how to do that.</p>

<p>The finite rate of increase over a time period is given by:</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to reduce the deer population from 71,655 back to 53,660 over 5 years.</p>
<p>To do this we need to calculate what harvest rate would achieve this while accounting for natural population growth.</p>
<p>The target is to have the net rate of change (growth minus harvest) result in the desired decline. We can set up the equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20N_t%20=%20N_0%20%5Ctimes%20e%5E%7B(r%20-%20h)%20%5Ctimes%20t%7D%20"></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"> is the harvest rate we want to solve for. Rearranging:</p>

<p>The plot clearly shows the diverging trajectories.</p>
<p>So why is my number of 12% per year so much lower than the 25% per year cited in the Tasmanian study?</p>
<p>For one, my calculation doesn’t account for the spatial dynamics and increasing range. Deer moving into new areas with fresh vegetation can sustain higher growth rates. For another my calculation assumes a stable age structure. This means that the proportion of juveniles to adults remains constant, which may not be the case in a rapidly growing population.</p>
<p>More sophisticated models, <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.14546">like the one used in this study</a>, would be needed to capture these dynamics accurately.</p>

  <title>Does data from protected areas help to improve ecological forecasts? New pre-print</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-23-ecological-forecasts-MPAs/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Sharing the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5647239">research work of my Master’s student, Leigha Aitken, that is now available as a pre-print</a>. She sought to answer the question:</p>
<p>Does data from protected areas help to improve ecological forecasts?</p>
<p>As a pre-print it is not peer-reviewed, though it has been examined and reviewed by UTas staff in thesis form and we did address those concerns. Abstract below, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5647239">full pdf on SSRN</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="abstract" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Models are increasingly used to make forecasts to support fisheries management by translating ecological theory into quantitative predictions. However, forecasts for fisheries species are often constrained by limited data from unfished reference conditions. No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) can provide insight into unfished population dynamics, potentially improving models’ predictive performance. This study asked whether incorporating NTMR data improves the accuracy of annual abundance forecasts over eight years. We compared the predictive performance of first-order autoregressive models that were trained on abundance data from either NTMR sites, fished sites, or a mix of both site types. Each model was then tested by predicting to sites it was not trained on (‘transferred’). We tested the forecasts for both fished and unfished species with 23 years of time-series abundance data from the Maria Island (Tasmania) NTMR and nearby control sites. We found a general decrease in the performance of fished and NTMR models when forecasts were transferred to the opposite site type. Model transferability was species-specific, with the NTMR model reducing forecasting errors by approximately 10% at fished sites for one sustainably fished species. In contrast, for other species, the fished model reduced forecast errors by approximately 4% and 56% at NTMR sites. Additionally, we found that models trained on a mix of site types consistently underperformed. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for site- and species-specific dynamics. While NTMR data offers valuable insights into unfished conditions, further work is required to create models that transfer well to any exploitation regime.</p>

  <title>Environmental impacts of large language models</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-22-environmental-impacts-LLMs/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Just want to quickly highlight a few investigative blogs on the environmental impacts of LLMs.</p>
<p>There are two main issues: water use (for cooling servers) and carbon emissions generated by creating the hardware, training the models and then using the models to get responses (‘inference’).</p>
<p>This blog does a deep dive on the <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/the-ai-water-issue-is-fake">water issues</a>. The key finding is that the water issues seem to be overstated (he says ‘fake’ but I don’t agree with that word choice, water issues are real, just overstated).</p>
<p>Then academic Hannah Ritchies and author of ‘Sustainability by Numbers’ page sums up the <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/carbon-footprint-chatgpt">carbon cost of chatGPT</a>. She draws heavily on <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/a-few-meta-points-on-my-posts-on">Andy Masley</a> detailed work.</p>
<p>In particular, blog author (<a href="https://www.andymasley.com/">Andy Masley</a>) argues that the public has limited attention span for environmental issues and AI isn’t the biggest priority. He sums it up nicely:</p>
<p>“AI water use is mostly fake, personal prompt costs are mostly fake, but AI as a whole is going to put a huge strain on our electrical grid going forward that’s going to matter a lot for the green energy transition, local electricity prices, and air pollution”</p>
<p>By fake, he means your personal usage is trivially small. He highlights golf courses and streaming videos as much larger uses of water and emissions respectively.</p>
<p>What also matters is the counterfactual - ie what would you be doing if you weren’t using chatGPT? If you would be online shopping, using a microwave or streaming videos instead, then your personal emissions are probably slightly lower if you switch your time to chatGPT.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the impacts of your AI use you can easily do a personal offset by commiting to some simple behaviour changes. <a href="https://www.it.ox.ac.uk/article/reducing-energy-consumption-pcs">e.g.&nbsp;turn you computer off at night and turn it off at the power plug</a>.</p>
<section id="what-about-coders" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-coders">What about coders?</h2>
<p>One unaddressed question in these posts is the personal impacts of genAI power users (like me). By that I mean people using it for coding. The blogs above deal with people who are doing the occaisonal short chatGPT prompt. Coders might be leaning on AI hundreds of times a day for prompts that range from short to very long (and more energy intensive).</p>
<p>That’s something I’d like to do the numbers for later on.</p>

  <title>modelbased package for plotting interactions</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-21-modelbased/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been a big fan of the <code>visreg</code> package for a while, it makes it convenient to plot predictions from models. But recently I was struggling with a model that had many two-way interactions terms.</p>
<p>I checked out the key alternative to <code>visreg</code>, <code>ggeffects</code>, which is very popular (the paper has over 2000 citations). But the <code>ggeffects</code> page states it will be superseded by the <a href="(https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/)"><code>modelbased</code> package</a>. So here’s a quick demo of how to use <code>modelbased</code> to plot interaction effects from a GLM.</p>
<p><code>modelbased</code> is part of an ecosystem of packages for handling statistical models: <a href="https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/reference/estimate_slopes.html#references"><code>easystats</code></a>.</p>

<p>Now we’ll fit a simple poisson GLM. <code>pres.topa</code> is count of topa fish, a fish that likes to live in branching corals (<code>cb_cover</code>), and <code>logged</code> is a binary variable indicating whether the site was near to logging or not (which causes pollution that harms fish and corals).</p>

<p>It simple to then plot the interaction effects. I’m going to do so on <code>link</code> scale (log scale for poisson models):</p>

<p>One neat thing that <code>modelbased</code> does is give you different options for how to estimate marginal means. The default is “typical”, which estimates marginal means at the average value of numerical predictors and averages over frequencies of categorical predicotrs. But you can also do “average” which averages over sample distributions and “population” which attemps to create a counterfactual for all possible combinations of variables.</p>
<p>These answer different questions, see the <a href="https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/reference/estimate_means.html">documentation for more details</a>.</p>
<p>I’m going to make a dataframe of all three methods so we can compare them:</p>

<p>You can see see some key differences. The typical method shows effects of hard coral cover for a typical observation. There are slightly more unlogged than logged sites in the data:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb16" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>
    Logged Not logged 
        21         28 </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>So the typical sample is different from a balanced population level average.</p>
<p>The population and typical predictions fall in between the predictions that are conditional on logging status, because both are kinds of averages over the two logging categories.</p>
<p>Predictions from the ‘average’ method show an inconsistent pattern, because they are averaging over samples. You can roughly see the trends for logged and unlogged sites.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s convince ourselves that the unbalanced data is causing these differences. I’m going to randomly remove some unlogged sites to create a balanced dataset, and refit the model:</p>

  <title>Resource for using Large Language Model tools in R</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-06-llm-tools-for-r-book/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>If you’re interested in using Large Language Models (LLMs) with R, you should check out Luis D. Verde Arregoitia’s new online resource: <a href="https://luisdva.github.io/llmsr-book/index.html">Large Language Model tools for R</a>. Its available in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>The resouce provides a comprehensive guide to working with LLMs in R, covering packages, techniques, and practical applications.</p>
<p>This is a great complement to my <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/">workshop and book</a> that guides you through some of the options and prompt engineering for high quality R analyses.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to integrate AI capabilities into your R workflows, this book is definitely worth exploring.</p>

  <title>New online book AI Assistants for Scientific Coding</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-05-AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve released a new online book, <a href="https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/">AI Assistants for Scientific Coding</a>. It’s a practical guide to using language models to support scientific computing and analysis.</p>
<p>The book focuses on helping people who already use R or Python for data analysis. It’s not an introduction to programming; instead, it shows how to work with AI tools effectively and responsibly once you know the basics.</p>
<p>What you’ll find inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing and using AI coding assistants, from simple chat tools to agents that can run and test code</li>
<li>Prompting strategies that improve reliability for real analysis tasks</li>
<li>Examples from environmental science (GLMs, multivariate stats), with methods general to other fields</li>
<li>Notes on ethics, copyright, costs, and environmental impacts</li>
</ul>
<p>Read it here: https://www.seascapemodels.org/AI-assistants-for-scientific-coding/</p>
<p>The material also serves as reference notes for a one‑day workshop and will evolve as the field changes. If you’re interested in the prompting side of statistical workflows, there’s an accompanying preprint: https://doi.org/10.32942/X2CS80</p>

  <title>Automating the Github Copilot Agent from the command line with Copilot CLI</title>
  <link>https://www.seascapemodels.org/posts/2025-10-04-running-github-copilot-CLI-agents-from-R/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli">Github Copilot CLI (Command Line Interface)</a> recently became available. It is an AI agent, meaning it can use tools autonomously in a loop. It has two modes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>An interactive mode that is like a terminal version of the Copilot agent that runs in the chat window</p></li>
<li><p>A programmatic mode that can be run with shell scripts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Copilot CLI is available with paid versions of github copilot.</p>
<p>The programmatic mode interested me, because it allows you to write scripts that call github copilot agents. This means you could run replicate agents on the same problem, then gather there results for analysis.</p>
<p>I, of course, want to do everything from the R program, because I’m not great with unix code or Python. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli">Once you’ve setup the copilot CLI</a>, its very easy to run it from R:</p>
<pre><code>
copilot_cmd &lt;- "copilot -p 'Set-up this project directory with a readme.md file, and directories for outputs, scripts, plots.' --allow-all-tools"

system(copilot_cmd)
</code></pre>
<p>This will run the agent autonomously in the current working directory of your R session.</p>
<p>Now I wouldn’t recommend using <code>--allow-all-tools</code> like this however. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#security-considerations">There are important security considerations</a>. Like prompt injection attacks where an Agent goes on the web and gets tricked into doing something bad to your computer when it reads some malicious content. Likewise, agents can just stuff up and just delete or overwrite a bunch of files you wanted to keep.</p>
<p>You do need to allow some tools however, otherwise you might as well run the agent in interactive mode (because you’ll have to manually approve every tool use). This defeats the time-saving goal of running agents in a loop.</p>
<p>Here’s my current set-up:</p>
<p><code>copilot -p 'A prompt here' --allow-all-tools --deny-tool 'shell(cd)' --deny-tool 'shell(git)' --deny-tool 'shell(pwd)' --deny-tool 'fetch' --deny-tool 'extensions' --deny-tool 'websearch' --deny-tool 'githubRepo'"</code></p>
<p>I allow all tools, then prevent tools related to changing working directory, accessing the web or viewing directory context.</p>
<p>There is still some risk here. e.g., if you want it to run Rscripts you might want to include in your prompt something like ‘Use <code>Rscript my-script.R</code> to run R scripts from the terminal.’ The R scripts could include anything (including connecting to the web).</p>
<p>Here’s an example in action. I use sprintf to format the terminal command with the prompt, tools and sub-directory path.</p>
<pre><code>copilot_prompt &lt;- "Set-up this project directory with a readme.md file, and directories for outputs, scripts, plots. Then create example data to illustrate a poisson GLM. Make prediction plots. Use `Rscript 'my-script.R'` to run R files. "

copilot_tools &lt;- "--allow-all-tools --deny-tool 'shell(cd)' --deny-tool 'shell(git)' --deny-tool 'shell(pwd)' --deny-tool 'fetch' --deny-tool 'extensions' --deny-tool 'websearch' --deny-tool 'githubRepo'"

subdir_path &lt;- "dir1"

<p>From here it would be easy to create a loop over different subdirectory paths, and run a separate agent in each one. The advantage of <code>cd</code>ing into each path before the agent opens is that the agent can’t then see context from other sub-directories. So you get independent agent runs.</p>
<p>You could use this to see how different prompts perform, or do complex prompt strategies like ‘tree of thought’. In tree of thought you ask an agent to create the same thing many times, it will do it slightly differently each time. Then you aggregate the results and pick the most common or most accurate one.</p>
<p>My one gripe is that Github have provided us with woeful documentation of what the tool names are. I’m guessing the tools are what you can see if you open the chat window, click ‘Agent’ mode, then click the tool symbol.</p>
<p>I’d love to have some default tool sets that simplify the tool permissions. For instance a tool set that locks down all web access.</p>
