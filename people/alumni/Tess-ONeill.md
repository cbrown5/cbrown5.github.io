# Tess O'Neill

Tess worked with us as a research assistant (2024), as well as studying for her honours degree in Marine and Antarctic Science with the University of Tasmania. For her thesis she modelled the effects of giant kelp restoration on fisheries. She [predicted significant benefits for some coastal fisheries in Tasmania](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.16.628810v1.abstract). A further important finding was predicting a significant increase in coastal primary productivity if we are able to meet the 30% restoration target for giant kelp in Tasmania.

Her thesis has been submitted for publication and the [pre-print is available here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.16.628810v1.abstract).
