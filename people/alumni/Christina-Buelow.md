# Christina Buelow
Christina joined the team in 2019 as a postdoctoral fellow on the [Global Wetlands Project](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/).

She worked on informing conservation actions for coastal wetlands at the global scale. In particular, she is working with the [Global Mangrove Alliance](http://www.mangrovealliance.org/) to inform on how conservation actions can be scaled up from local to global scales. 

She graduated with a PhD in Environmental Science from James Cook University in 2018. She is currently based at the University of Sydney. 

Key research includes: 

- [Ambitious global targets for mangrove and seagrass recovery](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.02.013)
- [Enabling conservation theories of change](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01245-y)
- [Projecting Uncertainty in Ecosystem Persistence Under Climate Change](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70468)
