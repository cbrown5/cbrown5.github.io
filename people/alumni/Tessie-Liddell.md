A PhD candidate at Griffith University's College of Art, Tessie is an animation artist. She is studying how animation can be used to communicate the impacts of land-use change on riverine and marine ecosystems. She is particularly interested in turning science into a narrative that will resonate with people outside of a scientific audience. You can view some of her works [here](https://www.theloop.com.au/oshinkooshinko/portfolio/Animator/Brisbane).
