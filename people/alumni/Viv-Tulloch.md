Viv was working with us on the [Global Wetlands Project](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/) as the team's statistical ecologist. She created global scale models of threats to coastal wetlands.

Late in 2019 she moved to the [University of British Columbia in Canada](https://www.taramartin.org/people/) to do work on multiple stressors of ecosystems.

Viv graduated with a PhD from the University of Queensland's Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions in 2017, co-supervised by Chris. She is interested in planning for the impacts of run-off to marine ecosystems and ecosystem management.
