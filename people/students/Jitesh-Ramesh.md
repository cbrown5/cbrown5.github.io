Jitesh started his Honours with UTas mid-2025, supervised by Dr Brown and Dr Scott Bennett. He is studying productivity shifts in Australia's south-east marine ecosystems. 

Australia’s south-east marine ecosystems have undergone dramatic changes over the past three decades. This project will integrate multiple lines of evidence to test for a system-wide productivity change that spans shelf and coastal reef ecosystems. The project’s findings have implications for the management of fisheries and conservation of south-east marine ecosystems. Several studies independently point to productivity declines in different south-east marine ecosystems. This project will integrate data from trawl fisheries, reef surveys and macroalgal productivity estimates to ask if these disparate trends share a common driver. The project will use ecosystem modelling tools to ask if fishing and climate are causing system wide change in productivity.
