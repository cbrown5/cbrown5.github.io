Alexandre started his PhD with UTas mid 2025. He is studying "Integrated assessment of marine systems" supervised by Dr Brown with cosupervision from Dr Beth Fulton and Dr Katie Cresswell. 

Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs) are used to evaluate the state of ecosystems to inform management, policy and monitoring. In contrast to existing frameworks for marine ecosystem management, they synthesize and analyse natural, social, and economic factors. Their primary aim is to inform ecosystem management by integrating scientific data to support decision-making processes. With increasing activities in Australian marine territory, there is a growing concern about potential threats to marine ecosystems. A multi-sectoral approach is essential for identifying and prioritizing risks to the environmental and social outcomes associated with emerging ocean industries, such as aquaculture and renewable energy. This integrated approach can help assess how human activities impact ecosystems and guide measures to achieve triple-bottom-line outcomes.
