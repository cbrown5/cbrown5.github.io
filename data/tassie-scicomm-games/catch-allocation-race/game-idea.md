I want to make a game about sharing fish catches between commercial and recreational fishing sectors. 

The goal of the game is to keep everyone happy. The game play is continuous. 

In the game, the player sees three boxes. 

1. A pond full of fish. Fish numbers change according to the logistic growth model with catches from both sectors. 

2. A management panel where the player has two slider bars. The first slider bar is for total recreational catch. The second slider is for total commercial catch. 

3. A final panel that shows performance on outcomes for the environment, commercial fishing and recreational fishing. Use emojis for each sector to illustrate how happy or unhappy they are. Environmental happiness is based on the number of fish. Commercial and recreational happiness is based on their catches. Be creative here. 

Game play is continuous for 1 minute. At the end the player is aiming to make a good balance and keep everyone happy.
